200- 3000’ below within 10 miles of airport
• Marshalling signals- this gate, stop, chocks removed, fire in left engine
• Mcrit- when shockwave first appears on airplane
• Expired ppc in commercial op-what can you do?
• Density altitude increase- how does it affect IAS and take off run of turbocharged airplane
• As density altitude increases what happens to high and low speed buffet boundaries
• Transport category airplane can go how far without carrying life rafts
• Leave winnipeg on polar flight at FL270, exit SCA - what airspace are you in now
• Good captain qualities
• How to prevent cfit- how to use gpws, knowledge of terrain,
• T/o with frost on underside of wings - ok as per aircraft operations manual
• PAPI lights from airport chart with 12’ eye to wheel height
• Fuel gauges- capacitance corrected for temp?
• Vortex generators- delay boundary layer separation
• Frost on wings will disrupt air flow
• All chart style perf questions (no spaghetti charts)
• Different kinds of hydroplaning
• What a diffuser section does - specifically to pressure and air velocity
• TUC at 30000
• Mushy what makes a good captain question (obvious)
• ATPL will let you be PIC of any airplane class or type endorsed on your license
• 3 takeoffs and landings within 90 days
• Type 1 fluid use - removes already accumulated contamination
• Turbo jet max hold speed at 19000’
• Jet must be able to land and stop within 60% of available runway length
• Purpose of negative psi relief valve
• How pressurization is maintained (controlled- outflow valve)
• Ears popping -normal
• Large airplane -12566
• Heavy for weight turbulence category- 300,000lbs (they give KG as an option too so beware)
• Purpose of MEL- so crew don’t have to decide what is airworthy?
• 705 when is FA required?
• Wing stalling - at a particular AOA
• How to stop airplane quickest (mains, reverse, nose wheel, braking)
• What to do in event of TCAS RA
• Briefing special needs (blind pax)
• Recommend thunderstorm avoidance (in NM depending if above or below freezing layer)
