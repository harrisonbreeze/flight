stall aggravated by yaw
wings produce little lift - outer wing more than inner wing
power would flatten and fasten the spin
flaps would flatten spin and could cause damage
aft CG would flatten the spin and impede recovery
heavier aicraft increases spin inertia
less backpressure or rudder input during the spin could lead to a
	spiral dive (huge acceleration)
opposite ruder if not combined with reduced angle of attack may lead
	to a spin in the opposite direction (neutralize rudder after
	spin has been stopped)
TODO: review underbanking tendency and angle of attack at each wing
