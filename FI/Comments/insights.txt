any bank angle can be flown uncoordinated
->
any bank angle can be flown without adding extra load
->
a 90deg bank angle can be flown without turning using elevator as rudder and rudder as elevator
->
load factor = 1 / cos b is only valid for coordinated turns
->
only inertia creates loads
->
without (negative / positive) acceleration, there is no extra load
->
horizontal acceleration during a turn is centripetal force
->
centripetal force is opposed by inertia to the outside of the turn
->
without turning, there is no centripetal force and, hence, no inertia and no additional load
