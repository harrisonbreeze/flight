- use concrete qualification in the cockpit and PGIs if possible (e.g. few millimeters)
- brief comments instead of long explanation
- teach LP not exercise and always include fam demo
- review, demo, practice, fam demo with different levels of feedback
- student levels:
	I.   They don't know
	II.  They know but have to correct
	III. They know and anticipate

- avoid "...as I said before..."
- keep it simple - more doing than explaining
