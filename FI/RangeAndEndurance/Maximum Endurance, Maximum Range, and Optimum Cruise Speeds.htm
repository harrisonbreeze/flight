This article was inspired by the excellent CAFE Foundation flight
test article on the RV-6A in the September 1993 <i>Sport Aviation</i>.
On page 37, the author (there are so many, I don't know who wrote
this part) talks about an optimum cruise speed he call's "Carson's
Speed." Well, in 13 years of studying and working in flight
mechanics (performance, stability and control), I have never heard
of "Carson's Speed." For that matter, neither had any
of the flight mechanics gurus in the USAF Academy Department of
Aeronautics. Needless to say, this new concept caught our attention.
</p><p>
Fortunately, the author cited the AIAA paper where Carson developed
this concept (AIAA-80-1847). So I cruised on over to the USAF
Academy library and picked up a copy. After studying the paper,
this seemed like a good time to review the basic performance speeds.
</p><p>
Of course, Norm would prefer that I go through a detailed, rigorous
mathematical derivation of these concepts, including stuff such
as triple integrals as found in Green's Theorem:
</p><p>

<p>
(Whoa! I'm starting to have flashbacks to my partial differential
equations course!) Norm seems to think this would improve our
standing for next year's McKillop award. Unfortunately, the only
thing I want to do less than read something like that is to write
something like that. Therefore, we'll take the "Math-lite"
or qualitative approach for this explanation. If you want the
heavy duty mathematics, get a copy of Carson's paper.

</p><h2><a name="Fuel_Flow_and_Power"></a>Fuel Flow and Power </h2>

<p>
Before launching into the various performance speeds, we need
to first establish a relationship between power and fuel flow.
As it turns out, fuel flow is directly proportional to power output.
The constant of proportionality is the specific fuel consumption
(SFC), defined as such:
</p><p>
</p><center><img src="Maximum%20Endurance,%20Maximum%20Range,%20and%20Optimum%20Cruise%20Speeds_files/eqn2.gif" alt="SFC = lb of fuel/(BHP*hr)" align="BOTTOM" width="116" height="41"></center>
<p>
The SFC is normally a constant, and will be considered such for
these analyses. A typical value of SFC for reciprocating engines
is 0.5 lbs of fuel/BHP-hour. The important concept for these analyses
is that fuel flow is proportional to power output, that is:
</p><p>

<p>
Note also that propeller efficiency will be considered constant.

</p><h2><a name="Performance_Charts"></a>Performance Charts </h2>

<p>
To analyze our cruise performance, we start out with the Drag
Polar. This is shown in the bottom half of <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>.
The drag polar is simply a plot of aircraft drag vs. aircraft
velocity. The drag polar shown is the same as the RV-6A drag polar
presented on page 37 of the September 1993 <i>Sport Aviation</i>.
Note that the velocity is expressed in calibrated airspeed. For
you aeronautical engineering purists out there, this is technically
the equivalent airspeed. However, for the airspeeds we are talking
about, the calibrated and equivalent airspeed are essentially
equal. To get the drag back to coefficient form, you would need
to use the density for sea level.
</p><p>
<a name="Figure_1"></a></p><center><img src="Maximum%20Endurance,%20Maximum%20Range,%20and%20Optimum%20Cruise%20Speeds_files/fig1.gif" alt="Thrust and Power Curves" align="BOTTOM" width="552" height="558">
<p>
<b>Figure 1</b></p></center>
<p>
Since thrust (T) is equal to drag (D) in level flight at constant
speed, the lower chart also tells us the <i>thrust required</i>
to overcome drag to maintain a given velocity. Thus, it is also
called the <b>thrust required chart</b>.
</p><p>
The upper chart of <a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a> is the <b>power
required chart</b>. Power is simply thrust multiplied by velocity
(TV), so we get the power required chart by taking each point
on the thrust required chart and multiplying by the corresponding
velocity. This chart tells us the power required to maintain a
given velocity.
</p><p>
<a href="#Top">Go to Top</a>
</p><h2><a name="Maximum_Endurance"></a>Maximum Endurance </h2>

<p>
To maximize the endurance, we want to maximize the amount of <b>time</b>
that we can stay in the air. In order to do this, we must minimize
the fuel flow. Since the fuel flow is proportional to the power
required, the fuel flow will be minimized at the point where the
power required is a minimum. The speed corresponding to the bottom
of the power required curve is the speed for maximum endurance
(<a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>).
</p><p>
<a href="#Top">Go to Top</a>
</p><h2><a name="Maximum_Range"></a>Maximum Range </h2>

<p>
To maximize the range, we want to get the maximum distance for
each pound of fuel burned. Starting with our basic relation
</p><p>
</p><center><img src="Maximum%20Endurance,%20Maximum%20Range,%20and%20Optimum%20Cruise%20Speeds_files/eqn3.gif" alt="Fuel Flow proportional to Power" align="BOTTOM" width="112" height="18"></center>
<p>
or, splitting out the units
</p><p>
</p><center><img src="Maximum%20Endurance,%20Maximum%20Range,%20and%20Optimum%20Cruise%20Speeds_files/eqn4.gif" alt="lb fuel/hr proportional to Power" align="BOTTOM" width="109" height="36"></center>
<p>
Now if we divide both sides by velocity, we get
</p><p>
</p><center><img src="Maximum%20Endurance,%20Maximum%20Range,%20and%20Optimum%20Cruise%20Speeds_files/eqn5.gif" alt="lb fuel/(hr*(nm/hr)) proportional to Power/V" align="BOTTOM" width="132" height="58"></center>
<p>
Dividing out the hours, we get
</p><p>
</p><center><img src="Maximum%20Endurance,%20Maximum%20Range,%20and%20Optimum%20Cruise%20Speeds_files/eqn6.gif" alt="lb fuel/nm proportional to Power/V" align="BOTTOM" width="110" height="35"></center>
<p>
Note that the left side is what we wanted, pounds of fuel per
nautical mile. To minimize the pounds of fuel per nautical mile,
we can minimize the ratio of power over velocity. Looking at the
<a href="#Figure_1">power required chart</a>, a line from the
origin to any point on the curve has the slope of power over velocity
(P/V). As you trace a line from the origin to each point on the
curve, the slope will be a minimum when the line is tangent to
the power required curve. Therefore, the maximum range airspeed
occurs where a line from the origin is tangent to the power required
curve. This also corresponds to the minimum point on the thrust
required curve (drag polar).
</p><p>
<a href="#Top">Go to Top</a>
</p><h2><a name="Optimum_Cruising_Speed"></a>Optimum Cruising Speed
(Carson's Speed) </h2>

<p>
Unfortunately the maximum range airspeed is generally a lot slower
than most people wish to fly. After all, you built an airplane
to get places fast. Since we are also interested in getting places
fast, we must consider speed. So consider a parameter of fuel
flow per knot (Fuel Flow/knot). This would tell us how much fuel
per hour we are burning for each knot of velocity. The optimum
speed would then be the speed where this parameter is a minimum.
Mathematically, the derivative with respect to velocity would
equal zero, or
</p><p>
</p><center><img src="Maximum%20Endurance,%20Maximum%20Range,%20and%20Optimum%20Cruise%20Speeds_files/eqn7.gif" alt="d(Fuel Flow/knot)/dV = 0" align="BOTTOM" width="117" height="56"></center>
<p>
Qualitatively, at this point, if we increase the velocity, the
parameter (Fuel Flow/knot) would increase. Likewise, if we decrease
the velocity, the parameter (Fuel Flow/knot) would increase. Thus,
this would seem to be the optimum cruise speed.
</p><p>
To find this speed, consider that since fuel flow is proportional
to power, we would have
</p><p>
</p><center><img src="Maximum%20Endurance,%20Maximum%20Range,%20and%20Optimum%20Cruise%20Speeds_files/eqn8.gif" alt="Fuel Flow/knot proportional to Power/V" align="BOTTOM" width="117" height="35"></center>
<p>
Well, power divided by velocity is just thrust, so we can use
the thrust required curve (drag polar). A line from the origin
to any point on the thrust required curve has a slope of T/V.
If we divide both sides of the above equation by velocity, we
get
</p><p>
</p><center><img src="Maximum%20Endurance,%20Maximum%20Range,%20and%20Optimum%20Cruise%20Speeds_files/eqn9.gif" alt="((Fuel Flow/knot)/knot) proportional to ((Power/V)/V)" align="BOTTOM" width="175" height="56"></center>
<p>
The left side is what we want to minimize, and the right side
is the slope of the line from the origin to a point on the <a href="#Figure_1">thrust required curve</a>.
The minimum slope of this line occurs when it is tangent to the
thrust required curve. This velocity, then, is the optimum cruising
speed (Carson's Speed).

</p><h2><a name="How_Do_I"></a>How Do I Find These Speeds Without
A Drag Polar For My Airplane? </h2>

<p>
You can find the speed for the maximum lift to drag ratio (L/D<sub>max</sub>)
right in your Pilot's Operating Handbook (if you have one). Look
under emergency procedures for engine failure. Find the recommended
glide speed for maximum range. This glide speed is the speed for
L/D<sub>max</sub>  (I'll save you the derivation). This speed
also corresponds to the bottom of the drag polar. After all, if
lift is a constant for level flight, L/D<sub>max</sub> will occur
at the minimum drag. According to Carson, these three speeds are
related by factors of 3<sup>1/4</sup>, or about 1.316. So this
means:
</p><p>
</p><center>V<sub>max endurance</sub> = <img src="Maximum%20Endurance,%20Maximum%20Range,%20and%20Optimum%20Cruise%20Speeds_files/eqn10.gif" alt="Best Glide Speed/1.316" align="MIDDLE" width="102" height="36">
<p>
V<sub>max range</sub> = Best Glide Speed
</p><p>
V<sub>optimum cruise</sub> = (Best Glide Speed) * 1.316</p></center>
<p>
So now you can find these speeds for your airplane.

Aircraft are not designed solely for cruising; they must also
takeoff and climb. As a result, your airplane is carrying around
a lot more power than is required for cruising. Many production
aircraft ended up cruising around the optimum cruise speed by
empirical power sizing. For instance, the optimum cruise speed
for a Piper Tomahawk would be (70)*1.316 = 92 knots, which corresponds
to about 75% power. Of course, many of today's homebuilts, like
the RV-6A, have a much higher power to weight ratio, and are capable
of speeds well in excess of the optimum cruise speed. Check out
the reported cruise speeds for the RV-6A in <i>Sport Aviation</i>
compared to the reported optimum cruise speed. Just remember the
time honored axiom of all forms of transportation - <i><b>Speed
cost money...how fast do you want to go?</b></i>
