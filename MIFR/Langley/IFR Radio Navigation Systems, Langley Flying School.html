		</tr></tbody></table><a id="VOR"></a><h2>VOR</h2>

<p>VORs transmit between 108 to 117.95 MHz.&nbsp; On the ground, the transmitter looks like a Gemini space capsule.</p>

<p>Two signals are transmitted from the ground station, the first is the
 non-directional reference phase, and the second is the rotating 
variable phase.&nbsp; Both signals are transmitted 30 times per 
second.&nbsp; The variable phase transmits cyclically around the 360 
degrees of the azimuth approximately 30 times per second.&nbsp; The 
reference phase signal is transmitted every time the variable phase 
transmission sweeps past magnetic north.&nbsp; Radial information is 
derived from the difference in time between the two signals (which would
 be different for each radial); this computation is referred to as phase
 difference, and is displayed by the airborne equipment.</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Radio%20Navigation%20Systems,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Radio%252520Navigation%252520Reference%252520and%252520Variable%252520.gif"></p>

<p>&nbsp;The VOR receiver in the cockpit incorporates three functions: 
(1) the Omni Bearing Selector (OBS)&nbsp;which appears as a rotating 
azimuth dial which provides for bearing selection; (2) the Course 
Deviation Indicator&nbsp;(CDI), which is a vertical needle that moves 
laterally along a row of dots, each dot representing two degrees; the 
CDI can be centred by rotating the OBS; when this is done the aircraft 
position on one of the VOR radials is indicated; (3) the TO/FROM 
Indicator informs whether the aircraft bearing is “to” or “from” the 
VOR.</p>

<p>Before using a VOR, the instrument must be tuned and identified; to 
confirm the identity of the VOR, the “indent” function is turned on 
(much like a VHF radio) and the VOR identifier (three letters) is 
transmitted in Morse Code, which the pilot can read from his chart.</p>

<p>VOR&nbsp;receivers sometimes have internal testing capability; but 
major airports provide VOT equipment (VOR Testing), in which the 
VOT&nbsp;frequency is selected and the equipment tested.</p>

<p>The concept of a radial&nbsp;can be somewhat confusing.&nbsp; What 
has to be remembered is that there are 360 radials radiating from the 
VOR.&nbsp; If you are in reception range, and you have selected the 
proper frequency, the turning of the OBS will eventually centre the CDI 
(needle) with a FROM indication (arrow pointing downward)—when this is 
done the radial that the aircraft is on is indicated at the top of the 
azimuth.</p>

<p>What you have to be aware of, however, is that the rotation of the 
OBS 360° will in fact centre the needle twice, the first as just 
mentioned with a FROM indication (indicating the present radial), but 
also a second time with a TO indication.&nbsp; This feature—CDI centred 
with a TO indication—allows the pilot to determine instantaneously the 
course required to proceed directly to the VOR.&nbsp; To provide an 
example, note that both indications show that the aircraft is directly 
west of a VOR transmitter:</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Radio%20Navigation%20Systems,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Radio%252520Navigation%252520VOR%252520TO-From%252520Indications%25252.gif"></p>

<p>In the left display, the rotation of the OBS to 090° (at the top) has
 produced a centred CDI with a TO indication—essentially, the VOR is 
saying (if it could speak) fly 090° to proceed to the VOR.&nbsp; The 
aircraft must be to the west of the station.&nbsp; In the right display,
 with the aircraft in the exact same geographic position, the selection 
of 270° (using the OBS) has produced a centred CDI with a FROM 
indication—the VOR, in this case, is saying: fly 270° to proceed direct 
from the VOR.&nbsp; The radial the aircraft is currently on is only 
directly read from the right display, because it has a FROM 
indication.&nbsp; The present radial can also be discerned from the left
 display, but it has to be read at the bottom of the azimuth.</p>

<p>As you can see, the VOR information has nothing to do with the 
heading of the aircraft.&nbsp; It doesn’t know which way you have the 
thing pointed.&nbsp; To make sure you don’t get confused, it is always a
 good case to orient the aircraft in the same course as has been 
selected on the OBS.&nbsp; When this is done, all the directions make 
sense.</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Radio%20Navigation%20Systems,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Radio%252520Navigation%252520VOR%252520Orientation%252520Langley%25252.gif"></p>

<p>Another way to learn how to interpret information on the VOR display 
is to look at the four quadrants of a VOR.&nbsp; In the above example, 
the pilot has selected the 030° Radial—this appears at the top of the 
display.&nbsp; Note the various indications based on the quadrant in 
which the aircraft is located.&nbsp; To make comprehension easier, the 
aircraft depicted have been oriented to match the OBS selection of 030°.</p>

<p>In the upper left quadrant, the CDI is deflecting right, indicating 
to the pilot that the aircraft is to the left of course.&nbsp; To 
intercept the selected 030° Radial, the aircraft must be flown in the 
direction of the needle, but this only works if the aircraft is oriented
 to the OBS selection.&nbsp; Note the FROM indication, showing that the 
aircraft is to the north east of the 90° off-setting radials—a line 
combining the 300° and 120° Radials.&nbsp; In the upper right quadrant, 
everything is the same as the upper-left except the needle is deflecting
 left.&nbsp; Here (upper right quadrant) the pilot must fly left to 
intercept the selected 030° Radial.</p>

<p>Note that in the lower two quadrants the TO indication is 
displayed.&nbsp; Relative to the OBS setting, this tells that the VOR 
transmitter is in front of the aircraft.&nbsp; The reverse is the same 
for the upper quadrants, except the pilot is advised the VOR lies behind
 the oriented aircraft.</p>

<p>Full deflection of the CDI from the “on course” or central dot marker
 indicates the aircraft is positioned 10° or more from the selected 
radial.</p>

<p>Before using a VOR, the instrument must be tuned and identified; to 
confirm the identity of the VOR, the “indent” function is turned on 
(much like a VHF radio) and the VOR identifier (three letters) is 
transmitted in Morse Code, which the pilot can read from his chart.</p>

<p>VOR receivers sometimes have internal testing capability;<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">2</a>
 but major airports provide VOT&nbsp;equipment (VOR Testing), in which 
the VOT frequency is selected and the equipment tested.&nbsp; Using a 
VOT, the CDI must provide an “on course” and “TO” indication when the 
180° Radial is selected, and “on course” and “FROM” indication when the 
360° Radial is selected (when the 090° and 270° Radials are selected the
 “OFF” or “Nav-flag” indication will appear.</p>

<p>The accepted tolerance using a VOT is +/- 4°; a deflection beyond 4° renders the unit unserviceable.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">3</a></p>

<p>When checking the VOR over a known VOR checkpoint on the ground, the 4° tolerance is also applied.</p>

<p>Similarly, any variation greater than 4° degrees when two VOR 
receivers are tuned to the same signal is an unacceptable difference and
 one of the aircraft’s receivers must be regarded as unserviceable.</p>

<p>In contrast, an accepted tolerance of + /- 6° is applied to any 
airborne VOR check when the aircraft is positioned over a known landmark
 in association with a published radial.</p>

<p>A variation from VOR transmitters is VORTAC, which combines VOR 
functioning with DME (Distance Measuring Equipment).&nbsp; A military 
variation is TACAN&nbsp;(Tactical Air Navigation) which requires Ultra 
High Frequency equipment (UHF) and is not commonly used by General 
Aviation.</p>

<p>VORs are limited in that they transmit “line of sight;” thus the 
lower you fly, the closer you must be to pick up a signal; as a rule, 
1.23 times the square root of your altitude above the transmitter gives 
you the current range of a VOR in nautical miles (NM).</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Radio%20Navigation%20Systems,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Radio%252520Navigation%252520Line-of-Sight%252520Formula%252520Langl.gif"></p>

<p>The advantage of VOR rests with its reliance on VHF energy.&nbsp; VOR
 signals are not subject to the errors and inaccuracies of LF 
transmissions—especially needle oscillations during electrical storms.</p>

<a id="RMI Display"></a><h3>RMI Display</h3>

<p>Rather than a traditional VOR display, the position of an aircraft 
relative to a VOR transmitter can also be displayed by way of a Radio 
Magnetic Indicator&nbsp;(RMI) display.&nbsp; With an RMI, a bearing 
indicator continually points to the VOR station.&nbsp; The bearing 
indicator, in turn, is superimposed on an azimuth display that is 
virtually identical to the aircraft’s heading indicator.&nbsp; The 
azimuth, driven by a remotely mounted slaved compass, continually 
adjusts itself to reflect the aircraft’s heading—rotating just as the 
heading indicator rotates.&nbsp; In the example below, the aircraft is 
flying a heading of 086°, the bearing to the VOR is 055°, and the 
aircraft is currently crossing the 235° Radial.&nbsp; As discussed 
below, an RMI display can also be used to display ADF navigation 
information.</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Radio%20Navigation%20Systems,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Radio%252520Navigation%252520RMI%252520Display%252520Langley%252520Fly.gif"></p>

<a id="ADF"></a><h2>ADF</h2>

<p>ADF&nbsp;operates on low frequencies—200 KHz to 1750 KHz—which means 
commercial AM station broadcasts can be used, as well as navigation 
facilities.&nbsp; The transmission source most commonly used during IFR 
flight is the Non-directional Beacon (NDB).</p>

<p>ADF provides a homing function—that is, the needle in the ADF cockpit
 receiver points to the station (Bearing Indicator).&nbsp; Again, the 
receiver must be tuned and identified before use.</p>

<p>The advantage of ADF is that it is not limited to “line of sight” and
 is therefore effective for low-level navigation.&nbsp; The reason is 
that low frequency transmitters produce both ground&nbsp;and sky 
waves&nbsp;(signal bounces off the ionosphere).</p>

<p>The ADF, however, is subject to numerous inaccuracies:&nbsp; (1) 
Quadrantal Error, whereby the signal is bent by aircraft metal; 
quadrantal effect is minimal at the cardinal points (nose, tail and wing
 tips), and greater in the intermediate bearings; (2) Needle 
Oscillation, whereby the needle oscillates in conditions of static 
(rainfall and thunderstorms) and weak transmissions; (3) Night 
Effect&nbsp;the needle relies on the ionosphere reflection at night and 
becomes more inaccurate; (4) Terrain Effect, whereby the direction of 
radio waves is altered when passing between water and land, especially 
if the waves intercept the shore line at 30° or more; (5) Mountain 
Effect, whereby signals are altered as they reflect off mountains; and 
(6) Ore Deposits, which cause deflections.</p>

<p>Bearing Indicators and RMI</p>

<p>ADF information is conventionally displayed by one of three means, 
the first of which is referred to as a fixed card bearing indicator, the
 second is referred to as an adjustable bearing indicator, and the third
 is referred to as a Radio Magnetic Indictor (RMI).</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Radio%20Navigation%20Systems,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Radio%252520Navigation%252520ADF%252520Displays%252520Langley%252520Fl.gif"></p>

<p>In the case of the fixed-card bearing indicator, the ADF needle 
displays the relative bearing of the transmitter station—i.e., the 
bearing of the transmitter station relative to the longitudinal axis of 
the aircraft (relative bearing is discussed beginning P. 68).&nbsp; The 
ADF display card remains fixed with the 360° bearing set at the top of 
the azimuth display.</p>

<p>When ADF is displayed with an adjustable bearing indicator, the pilot
 can manually rotate the azimuth display so the aircraft’s current 
heading is displayed at the top of the azimuth.&nbsp; When this is done,
 the bearing indictor shows the magnetic bearing to the NDB—i.e., the 
heading that must be flown to proceed directly to the NDB.</p>

<p>In the case of an ADF equipped with an RMI, the azimuth is turned 
automatically by a remotely mounted slaved compass&nbsp;so that the 
heading of the aircraft is continually displayed at the top of the 
azimuth.&nbsp; Like a correctly set adjustable bearing indicator, the 
needle on the RMI always indicates the magnetic bearing to the NDB.</p>

<a id="ILS"></a><h2>ILS</h2>

<p>The Instrument Landing System&nbsp;(ILS) is the primary precision 
approach system used internationally, providing both horizontal 
(Localizer) and vertical (glidepath) guidance to a runway touchdown 
zone.</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Radio%20Navigation%20Systems,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Radio%252520Navigation%252520ILS%252520plan%252520and%252520profile%2525.gif"></p>

<p>ILS must have a final approach fix&nbsp;(FAF) which provides position confirmation; the FAF is either an NDB or a DME fix.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">4</a>&nbsp; The FAF is typically 4 NM from the runway,<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">5</a> but vary between 3.5 and 6 NM.</p>

<p>The Localizer of an ILS is normally located within 3° of the runway 
centreline, and provides guidance using the Course Deviation Indicator 
(CDI) similar to a VOR radial, but with far greater accuracy or 
sensitivity.&nbsp; While the full deflection on a VOR CDI equates to 10°
 (from the central or “on course” marker), full deflection of a CDI on a
 Localizer (also from the “on course” marker) is normally only 2.5°.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">6</a></p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Radio%20Navigation%20Systems,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Radio%252520Navigation%252520ILS%252520Needle%252520Deflections%252520.gif"></p>

<p>The Localizer is unidirectional in that only the approach end of the 
runway—referred to as the front course—has conventional CDI display and 
interpretation—e.g., left CDI deflection means “fly left” for on 
course.&nbsp; If you were to make an approach on to the opposite runway,
 and centreline signal is still transmitted via the Localizer, but the 
CDI is not “reverse read;” accordingly, a pilot making an approach on 
this opposite or reciprocal runway with a left CDI indication would have
 to “fly right” for the “on course.”&nbsp; This reverse-read side of the
 runway is referred to as the back course.&nbsp; If an aircraft is 
equipped with an HSI&nbsp;or Horizontal Situation Indicator (see below),
 which is essentially a CDI display superimposed on the Heading 
Indicator, the CDI display will not reverse read on the back course (as 
the pilot essentially sees the CDI upside-down).</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Radio%20Navigation%20Systems,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Radio%252520Navigation%252520HSI%252520Display%252520Langley%252520Fly.gif"></p>

<p>The “TO/FROM” indicator during the tracking of Localizer always 
indicates “TO” irrespective of the aircraft position relative to the 
transmitter, its only meaning being that the signal is reliable.</p>

<p>The transmitter of a Localizer signal is located on the centre line 
at the far end of runway for which is serves (i.e., off the departure 
end).</p>

<p>The glidepath transmitter&nbsp;is located approximately 1000’ back 
from the approach end of the runway it is serving.&nbsp; There is no 
back course glidepath signal transmitted.&nbsp; It projects an 
electronic glide slope to coincide with the Localizer—the glide slope 
usually being a 3° angle.&nbsp; The glidepath beam width is 
approximately 1.4°; therefore a full deflection of the glidepath needle 
(positioned as a “cross-hair” to the Localizer) from the “on glidepath” 
or centre-dot marker is only .7°—amazingly sensitive!</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Radio%20Navigation%20Systems,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Radio%252520Navigation%252520ILS%252520Conventional%252520Display%2525.gif"></p>

<p>Caution with respect to glidepath indication as false 
signals&nbsp;are transmitted in multiples of the glidepath angle.&nbsp; 
The first glidepath is approximately 6° above the horizontal.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">7</a>&nbsp; False signals are reciprocal (up and down indications are reversed.</p>

<p>A Localizer has specified areas of reliability.&nbsp; Outside this 
area, indications must be regarded as inaccurate.&nbsp; Approximately 18
 NM from the transmitter, the Localizer is reliable 10° either side of 
the on-track indication, while 10 NM from the transmitter, reliability 
increases to 35° either side of the on-track indication (below).</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Radio%20Navigation%20Systems,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Radio%252520Navigation%252520ILS%252520Area%252520of%252520Reliability.gif"></p>

<p>The Localizer is a VHF signal while the glidepath is a UHF signal 
that is “paired” with the VHF frequency.&nbsp; While the glideslope 
transmitter is located 400’ to 600’ off the runway centreline, between 
750’ and 1250’ back from the threshold.&nbsp; ILS frequencies are 
identified by a two-letter code with an “I” prefix.&nbsp; Thus, the 
Localizer for Abbotsford is “IXX.”&nbsp; When a Localizer frequency is 
published with an “X” prefix, the Localizer alignment exceeds 3° 
relative to the runway centreline, and a precautionary note is published
 on the approach plate.</p>

<p>ILS systems can be equipped with marker beacons<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">8</a>—low
 powered transmitters positioned below the Localizer.&nbsp; The outer 
marker&nbsp;is normally positioned at the FAF, while the middle 
marker&nbsp;is positioned below the Decision Height (DH) point.&nbsp; 
The marker transmitted an aural signal, and also illuminated flashing 
lights mounted in the audio panel.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">9</a></p>

<a id="DME"></a><h2>DME</h2>

<p>DME&nbsp;stands for Distance Measuring Equipment&nbsp;which provides 
the pilot with the slant-range distance from a DME ground station.&nbsp;
 The functioning of DME is distinct from VORs in that airborne equipment
 transmits a signal to the ground station, this transmission being 
composed of paired pulses; when the ground station receives this 
airborne signal, it in turn transmits reply paired pulses back to the 
airborne receiver on a difference frequency, but with the same pulse 
spacing.&nbsp; It is the time difference between this exchange of 
signals that is translated by the airborne equipment into distance in 
nautical miles.</p>

<p>DME signals are UHF and are therefore subject to line-of-sight 
limitations.&nbsp; DME frequencies are paired with VOR frequencies; 
therefore, by selecting the VOR VHF signal, the appropriate 
UHF&nbsp;frequency is automatically selected on the DME equipment—but 
you must pay close attention to depiction on navigation charts. DME is 
also paired with military TACAN signals—accordingly, while VOR equipment
 in civil aircraft cannot utilise TACAN signals (as TACAN signals are 
UHF), civil DME equipment can dial in TACAN frequency and obtain 
distance information.&nbsp; Note that VORTAC stations (combining 
military UHF and civil VHF) provide DME data.</p>

<p>Since the translated distance is slant range, and DME equipment in an
 aircraft at FL370 directly over a DME ground station (based at sea 
level) would indicate a distance to the pilot of not less than 6.08 NM.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">10</a>&nbsp; Accordingly, the higher and closer an aircraft to the DME ground station, the greater the slant range error.</p>

<p>The acceptable tolerance of DME indications in the cockpit is +/- .5 NM or 3% of the distance, whichever is greatest.</p>

<a id="Area Navigation Systems"></a><h2>Area Navigation Systems</h2>

<p>Area Navigation radio navigation systems permit expanded 
station-referenced and often self-contained electronic navigation over 
any desired flight path that is generally independent of conventional 
airways structure.</p>

<p>Area Navigation therefore revolves around track navigation between pilot-selected waypoints.</p>

<p>In many instances Area Navigation track information is conveyed to 
the pilot on an HSI&nbsp;display (left CDI deflection means steer left 
for the on course, etc.) and distance information similar to DME 
(distance to waypoint).</p>

<a id="INS"></a><h3>INS</h3>

<p>INS&nbsp;refers to Inertial Navigation System, a self-contained system that is independent of any external navigation aids.</p>

<p>The initial position of the aircraft is entered into the computer 
(usually the precise longitude and latitude of the aircraft on the 
airport ramp), and a system of two gyro-stabilised 
accelerometers&nbsp;measure acceleration of the aircraft relative to a 
north-south and east-west electronic grid.</p>

<p>Some INS systems incorporate ground station data input as a means of further enhancing accuracy.</p>

<p>The latest generation of INS systems—referred to as IRS&nbsp;for 
Inertial Reference System—uses laser sensors&nbsp;rather than gyros, and
 the date is directly inputted into an aircraft flight management 
system. &nbsp;</p>

<a id="RNAV"></a><h3>RNAV</h3>

<p>The term “RNAV” is currently used in two meanings, the first 
referring to all Area Navigation System—INS, IRS, GPS (also referred to 
as GNSS, meaning “Global Navigation Satellite System”), LORAN C, 
etc.—and the second sense denotes an airborne system that utilises 
conventional VORTAC and DME ground stations.&nbsp; In this section, RNAV
 denotes the latter conventional ground stations.</p>

<p>The airborne component of RNAV is a computer that takes radial and 
distance information from VORTAC and DME stations and allows the pilot 
to electronically create “phantom” VORTAC&nbsp;positions referred to as 
waypoints.&nbsp; Accordingly, by selecting a position referencing radial
 and DME from the nearest VORTAC, the pilot can electronically create a 
waypoint for that position such that the information received on the HSI
 and DME is as if a VORTAC existed there.</p>

<p>In the RNAV mode the CDI deflection of one dot indicates ½ NM off 
course, as opposed to the conventional 2° indication associated with a 
convention VOR or VORTAC indication.</p>

<a id="LORAN-C"></a><h3>LORAN-C</h3>

<p>LORAN-C&nbsp;is a low frequency, long-range navigation system in 
which the airborne receiver receives signal pulses from a widely spaced 
chain of ground stations.&nbsp; There are several chains in North 
American, each consisting of a master transmitting station&nbsp;and four
 secondary transmitting stations.&nbsp; The receiver computes aircraft 
position by measuring the time differences between the master station 
and at least two secondary stations.&nbsp; The pilot selects the chain 
of stations nearest to the aircraft position.</p>

<p>LORAN-C is far less accurate than GPS and it is not uncommon to have 
errors up to 8 NM.&nbsp; The receiver can lock onto erroneous sky wave 
or other signals without warning.&nbsp; The accuracy overall is 
dependent on the geometric angles&nbsp;between the aircraft and the 
ground transmitters—the greater this angle, the more accurate the data 
provided to the pilot.&nbsp; The signals can be affected by local low 
frequency transmitters and power lines.&nbsp; Also, precipitation static
 interferes with reception.&nbsp; The failure of one transmitter in the 
chain can render a large surrounding area without signal coverage.&nbsp;
 On the positive side the range of signal reception is very good—up to 
900 NM.</p>

<a id="GNSS"></a><h3>GNSS</h3>

<p>GNSS is a term used to encompass both the US GPS system and the 
Russian GLONASS&nbsp;system, both of which are satellite based 
systems.&nbsp; Discussion here will refer to the GPS system.</p>

<a id="GPS"></a><h4>GPS</h4>

<p>GPS<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">11</a> is perceived by
 ICAO as the navigation system of the 21st Century.&nbsp; Developed by 
the U.S. military, the system became operational for civil use in 1994, 
and now provides amazingly accurate navigation information to within 
only a few meters in space.</p>

<a id="Constellation"></a><h5>Constellation</h5>

<p>The system utilizes a network of 24 satellites&nbsp;(plus 5 standby 
satellites) orbiting 10,900 NM above the earth’s surface along 6 orbital
 planes.&nbsp; With each satellite passing over the same location on the
 earth two times per day, the orbital patterns are designed such that at
 least four satellites are within line of sight from almost any location
 on Earth.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">12</a>&nbsp;</p>

<a id="Measurement"></a><h5>Measurement</h5>

<p>The system is based on the measurement of distances between the 
airborne receiver and satellites, thereby establishing position 
information based on triangulation.&nbsp; Precise calculation of 
distances is made possible by atomic clocks carried on each satellite, 
and distance is derived from measuring the time required for a satellite
 signal to reach the airborne receiver.&nbsp; The current accuracy of 
GPS with respect to horizontal and vertical positions can be 6 meters 
and 8 meters, respectively, 95% of the time.</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Radio%20Navigation%20Systems,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Radio%252520Navigation%252520GPS%252520Probability%252520of%252520Posi.gif"></p>

<p>While only three satellites would be theoretically needed to 
determine a position based on triangulation, accuracy would be 
diminished by potential inaccuracies in the atomic clocks of any one of 
the three satellites.&nbsp; To compensate for possible time errors, four
 satellite signals are used and four satellites are considered the 
minimum number of satellites required for a reliably accurate position 
fix.</p>

<a id="&quot;P&quot; and &quot;C/A&quot; Codes"></a><h5>"P" and "C/A" Codes</h5>

<p>Until quite recently, GPS provided civilian aviation with what was 
referred to as “downgraded” navigation data.&nbsp; GPS satellites 
continue to transmitted (and perhaps still transmit) two types of code 
used for position identification—a “P” code, for “precise” navigation, 
and a “C/A” code, meaning “coarse acquisition” code.&nbsp; 
P-code&nbsp;provides “Precise Positioning Service” (PPS) that is only 
accessible to military receivers and requires a valid decryption key, 
while C/A code&nbsp;provides “Standard Positioning Service (SPS), 
accessible to all civilian receivers. Up until only a few years ago, SPS
 was a degraded PSS signal for reasons of national security,—a process 
referred to as Selective Availability&nbsp;(SA).&nbsp; In the winter of 
2000, however, the C/A code was upgraded (or perhaps temporarily 
removed) so that civilian operators now have access to data whose 
accuracy is estimated to be equivalent to P code. Presumably, the signal
 could be again downgraded in the event of a future security problem.</p>

<p>A GPS receiver identifies each accessible satellite within line of 
sight, accesses two data streams form the satellite—the navigation 
message (referred to as ephemeris) which contains orbital information 
that allows the receiver to calculate the satellites’ position, and the 
distinct C/A code (or P code if the receiver is military), which is 
simply clock information.&nbsp; The receiver then plots its estimated 
position from all available satellites using processed time and distance
 data—a measurement process referred to as pseudo range.&nbsp; The are 
numerous accuracy-degrading effects associated with GPS (ionospheric 
effects, ephemeris errors, satellite clock errors, multipath distortion,
 trophospheric effects, and numerical errors), but civilian GPS fixes 
are typically accurate to within about 50’.</p>

<a id="Leg and OBS Modes"></a><h5>Leg and OBS Modes</h5>

<p>Typically, GPS operates in two modes, the first being LEG mode, and 
the second being OBS mode.&nbsp; In LEG mode, the GPS will automatically
 cycle through a series of waypoints that are stored as a sequence in an
 electronic flight plan.&nbsp; Information display—distance, time, and 
speed—is always provided for the “next” waypoint in the sequence.&nbsp; 
If three waypoints are stored, for example—A,B, and C—the data 
pertaining to waypoint C will be displayed immediately after B is 
passed.&nbsp; In OBS mode the GPS will not cycle between waypoints, but 
will instead lock onto one waypoint, giving position information much 
like that of a traditional VOR—including TO and FROM indications.</p>

<p>VFR-only GPS receivers cannot detect erred data in satellite transmission.</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Radio%20Navigation%20Systems,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Radio%252520Navigation%252520GPS%252520Display%252520Langley%252520Fly.gif"></p>

<a id="IFR GPS and RAIM"></a><h5>IFR GPS and RAIM</h5>

<p>IFR-certified GPS receivers must continuously monitor the performance
 of the system to ensure accuracy—the idea being, of course, that IFR 
operation based on GPS must have accuracy in position determination to 
ensure clearance from terrain.&nbsp; The problem is that the GPS Space 
and Control Segments cannot instantly fix a satellite if it begins to 
send misleading data to receivers, and for this reason IFR GPS receivers
 cannot simply rely on the GPS satellites where this possibility of 
position error exists.&nbsp; To remedy this, the feature of 
RAIM—Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring—is included in IFR GPS 
equipment.&nbsp; “Receiver autonomous” means that the GPS can detect 
errors on its own, and it does this by using distance measurements from 
as many satellites as possible as a means of checking the consistency of
 the position (called over-determined position solution).&nbsp; If there
 are not enough satellites within reception range of the airborne 
receiver to assure position integrity, the receiver notifies the pilot.</p>

<p>Five measurements with good geometry concerning the satellite 
positions are needed to provide RAIM; since an IFR GPS utilises as a 
source of measurement the aircraft’s altimeter, the minimum number of 
satellites is four.&nbsp; If the measurements are inconsistent, the 
pilot is notified and RAIM does not exist.</p>

<p>RAIM availability is rarely a problem during the en route and 
terminal phases of IFR flight, but the allowable limits are much tighter
 when an IFR non-precision approach is being conducted—during this phase
 aircraft commonly descend without visual reference to within a few 
hundred feet of the ground.&nbsp; A “RAIM not available” signal is 
useless during these critical low-altitude phases of an IFR approach, so
 the IFR receivers have the capability to check RAIM availability at a 
future time—i.e., when the pilot is planning to conduct the 
approach.&nbsp; By knowing the future geometry of orbiting satellites, 
RAIM is predicted by the receiver for the pilot’s benefit.</p>

<p>An IFR pilot cannot conduct an approach unless predicted RAIM is checked and verified prior to crossing the Final Approach Fix.</p>

<p>It is required with IFR GPS systems that the waypoints that make up a
 GPS approach are not entered manually by the pilot.&nbsp; Instead, the 
equipment must be designed such that the waypoints are automatically 
loaded in the corrected sequence from a data card when a particular 
approach is selected by the pilot.</p>

<p>The navigation requirements that govern GPS operations in Canada are 
established in periodically updated Aeronautical Information 
Circulars.&nbsp; These apply to IFR operations.</p>

<a id="WAAS"></a><h4>WAAS</h4>

<p>There are numerous augmentation systems for GPS—systems that enhance 
the accuracy and reliability of GPS position determination.&nbsp; 
Perhaps the more prominent of these is the Wide Area Augmentation 
System&nbsp;(WAAS) has been developed by the U. S. FAA, and consists of a
 network of 29 ground stations (referred to as WRS—Wide-area Reference 
Stations---these are located the continental U.S., Hawaii, and Puerto 
Rico), and four geostationary satellites.&nbsp; GPS/WAAS receivers 
obtain position data from both the GPS satellite network, as well as 
ground stations (communicated via the WAAS stationary satellites) to 
civil position determination to within 1.0 meters laterally and 1.5 
meters vertically.&nbsp; WASS systems exist in Japan, Europe, and India.</p>

<a id="TSOs, LNAV, VNAV, and LPV"></a><h5>TSOs, LNAV, VNAV, and LPV</h5>

<p>We’ll end this section on GPS with a bunch of acronyms: “TSO” stands 
for “Technical Standing Order”, and GPS systems certified for IFR use 
that do not use WAAS fall under TSO-C129; GPS systems that do utilize 
WASS fall under TSO-C146a (required for Commuter and Airline 
operations).&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a rule, aircraft equipped with TSO-C129 GPS systems (non-WAAS) are
 only capable of utilizing “lateral” GPS signal information—i.e., 
horizontal position information--while aircraft equipped with TSO-C146a 
systems (WAAS) are capable of flying both “lateral” and “vertical” GPS 
signals.&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to instrument approaches&nbsp; 
TSO-C129 systems (non-WAAS) are only authorized to descend to 
LNAV&nbsp;(lateral navigation) minimum altitudes on the approach 
plate.&nbsp; In contrast, TSO-C146a systems (WAAS) can descend down to 
what are referred to as LNAV/VNAV&nbsp;(lateral/vertical navigation) and
 LPV&nbsp;(localizer performance with vertical guidance) minimum 
altitudes, which are typically much lower.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">13</a>&nbsp; That’s enough to fill your brain—we’ll return to this stuff when we discuss GPS approaches</p>

<a id="Radar"></a><h2>Radar</h2>

<p>Primary and Secondary</p>

<p>Two types of radar systems are in use: Primary Surveillance Radar 
&nbsp;(PSR ) and Secondary Surveillance Radar &nbsp;(SSR ).&nbsp; Both 
provide range (distance) and azimuth (direction) information of a target
 relative to a station.</p>

<p>PSR is non-enhanced radar that conveys information to the operator 
based only on radar reflections from contacts, and therefore is the only
 system that can detect weather precipitation.&nbsp; PSR does not rely 
on information transmitted from an aircraft, and therefore does not 
provide altitude data.</p>

<p>In contrast, SSR relies on airborne transponder and measure data based on SSR interrogation and transponder replies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;SSR cannot provide position information for aircraft that are 
not transponder equipped; nor can it provide information on 
weather.&nbsp; Its operation advantage is derived from increased range, 
positive identification and altitude information.</p>

<p>En Route and Terminal Control System</p>

<p>SSR is the main source of radar data for en route (airways) 
facilities.&nbsp; Independent Secondary Surveillance Radar &nbsp;(ISSR )
 is considered long-range radar, and is capable of providing coverage up
 to 250 NM.</p>

<p>In contrast, Terminal Surveillance Radar &nbsp;(TSR ) combines both PSR (80 NM range) and SSR (250 NM range).</p>

<a id="Precision Approach Radar (PAR)"></a><h3>Precision Approach Radar (PAR)</h3>

<p>PAR &nbsp;is a radar system used as an approach aid exclusively at military airports in Canada. <a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">14</a></p>

<p>It is characterised as a short range, high definition PSR system that
 provides highly accurate information related to altitude, azimuth and 
range—sufficient accuracy to be classified as a “precision approach” 
comparable to an ILS system.</p>

<a id="Airport Surface Radar"></a><h3>Airport Surface Radar</h3>

<p>The formal name for this system of radar is the Airport Surface 
Detection Equipment &nbsp;(ASDE ).&nbsp; It is also a short range, high 
definition PSR system that provides surface traffic information when 
airport visibility is reduced—aircraft and vehicle movements on runways 
and taxiways.</p>

<a id="Navigation Equipment Interference"></a><h2>Navigation Equipment Interference</h2>

<p>A recent crash of a commercial aircraft in Europe was attributed to 
cell phone use in the aircraft.&nbsp; Crew members should specifically 
advise passengers to turn off cell phones during flight.</p>

<p>FM radio and television broadcast receivers produce radiation that 
can interfere with ILS and VOR receivers, while AM radio receivers and 
electronic calculators can interfere with ADF receivers.</p>

<p>Should the ground transmitters associated with radio navigation aids 
be unserviceable, the identifying Morse Code&nbsp;signal is suspended; 
accordingly positive identification of a signal is crucial to safe 
navigation.</p>

<p>All abnormalities with radio navigation performance must be reported to ATS.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">1</a> HF frequencies are 
suited to locations where communication is required over long 
distances—long, over-water flights, and flights in northern 
Canada.&nbsp; HF is the only way to communicate over ranges of 2500 
miles or more.&nbsp; The quality of HF communication is somewhat 
unpredictable owing to the unpredictable nature of the ionosphere.&nbsp;
 Higher range HF frequencies are more efficient during the day, and 
lower range HF frequencies are more efficient at night.</p>

composed of three segments: the Space Segment, the Control Segment, and 
the User Segment.&nbsp; The Space Segment is composed of the 24 NAVSTAR 
satellites that orbit the earth.&nbsp; The satellite orbits are 
precisely planned so that the entire surface of the earth may use the 
GPS system 24 hours per day, every day.&nbsp; There are almost always 
more than six satellites in view from every location on Earth.&nbsp; The
 Control Segment consists of a network of ground-based monitoring and 
control stations, with the Master Control Station located in Colorado 
Springs.&nbsp; The satellite data is collected by other ground stations,
 but is assimilated and analysed in Colorado Springs.&nbsp; The Master 
Control Station has facility for the “uplinks” required, for example, to
 make system clock corrections.&nbsp; The User Segment includes pilots 
with GPS.</p>
