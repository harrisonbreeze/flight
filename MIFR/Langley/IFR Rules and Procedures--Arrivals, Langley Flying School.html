<p>In Canada, instrument approaches are developed by Transport Canada in
 accordance with the publication Criteria for the Development of 
Instrument Procedures (TP 308), and are published in the government 
publication Canada Air Pilot, as well as privately in the Jeppesen 
Airways Manual.</p>

<p>There are two broad categories of instrument approaches—precision 
approaches and non-precision approaches.&nbsp; There are two types of 
precision approaches—the ILS and Precision Approach Radar (PAR)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">1</a>—and three primary non-precision approaches—NDB, VOR, Localizer (including Localizer Backcourse), and GPS.</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Four%2520approach%2520segments.gif"></p>

<p>All approaches are composed of four segments—the initial, the 
intermediate, the final, and the missed approach.&nbsp; A fifth element 
is typically included in published approach procedures, and this is 
referred to as the circling element, which may for practical purposes be
 regarded as a feature of the final segment.&nbsp; Each of these 
segments has a standard with respect to obstacle and ground clearances.</p>

<a id="Initial Segment"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007526">Initial Segment</a></h3>

<p>The initial segment connects the published approach the en route 
structure (airways).&nbsp; It is during the initial segment that the 
aircraft departs the en route structure and begins to manoeuvre the 
aircraft into the intermediate segment.&nbsp; The initial segment may 
contain a specified transition, an arc, or it may simply be based on the
 published Minimum Sector Altitude (MSA).</p>

<p>The standard for published initial segment altitudes is 1000’ 
clearance over obstacle and terrain.&nbsp; Where a specified transition 
exists, the 1000’ minimum clearance extends 4 NM on either side of the 
published track.</p>

<a id="Initial Segment—MSA Transitions"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007527"></a><a name="_Ref16185146">Initial Segment—MSA Transitions</a></h3>

<p>&nbsp;MSA transitions&nbsp;are provided for in all published approach
 procedures.&nbsp; They are based on data provided in a format similar 
to Obstruction Clearance Circles in the Canada Flight Supplement, 
providing minimum obstacle and terrain clearance altitudes within 
specified sectors surrounding the airport.&nbsp; In the case of MSAs, 
however, the radius of minimum sector altitudes extends outward 25 NM, 
and are based on a specified published navigation aid—typically the 
Final Approach Fix, where this exists for an approach.&nbsp; When an MSA
 transition is used for the initial segment of the approach, the pilot 
must first determine that the aircraft is positioned with the specified 
25 NM radius—using GPS or DME data, a position fix, or radar 
services.&nbsp; Once this is determined, the pilot may safely descend 
from the altitudes specified for an airway to the minimum altitude 
specified for the sector in which the aircraft is positioned.&nbsp; The 
MSA data that appears on Abbotsford Airport&nbsp;approach plates appears
 below.</p>

<p><img alt="MSA Circle for Abbotsford Airport.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/MSA%2520Circle%2520for%2520CYXX.gif"></p>

<a id="Initial Segment—Specified Transitions"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007528">Initial Segment—Specified Transitions</a></h3>

<p>While MSA transitions are published for all approach procedures, 
specified transitions appear on selected approach plates, especially 
busy airports.&nbsp; There are two types of specified transitions—those 
with published straight-line tracks, and those with published 
arcs.&nbsp; Arcs are simply “curved” tracks, and will be discussed 
below.</p>

<p><img alt="Powell River's IFR Approach Plate, depicting transitions routes.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Powell%2520River%2520Planview%2520with%2520transitions.gif"></p>

<p>Straight-line transition tracks appear on approach plates in a format
 similar to en route airways.&nbsp; The pilot is provided with track 
orientation, distance, and minimum altitude data.&nbsp; They provide 
track guidance either to the Final Approach Fix, from which a procedure 
turn may be flown, or to what is referred to as an Intermediate Fix, 
where the procedure turn may be skipped or by-passed in the approach 
sequence, allowing the pilot to navigate directly to the final approach 
course.&nbsp; Powell River&nbsp;(above) provides an example of a 
transition directly to the Final Approach Fix.&nbsp; Transition via the 
AGGUA Intersection—which is published on the en route charts as an 
intersection on V347 (N50 15.3 W124 59.9)—would be referred to as the 
“Aggua Transition.”&nbsp; From AGGUA, a track of 123° is flown, 
eventually leading directly to Powell River NDB.&nbsp; From the 14000’ 
MEA of V347, a pilot conducting an approach using this transition is 
authorised to descend to 7400’, providing a slight advantage over the 
MSA minimum values.&nbsp; In contrast, the “Comox” transition via the 
Comox NDB permits a descent to 4000’.&nbsp; The Comox 
transition&nbsp;also appears on the en route charts as airway A16.</p>

<p>In the case of the Powell River transitions—or in the case of any 
other straight-line transition that leads directly to the Final Approach
 Fix (FAF)—a procedure turn must be flown after arriving at the FAF in 
order for the pilot to manoeuvre the aircraft onto the final approach 
course.&nbsp; The crossing of a FAF for the purpose of entering a 
procedure turn marks the end of the Initial Segment, and the beginning 
of the Intermediate Segment.&nbsp; That is to say, the procedure turn 
is, in these types of approaches, the Intermediate Segment.</p>

<a id="Intermediate Segments—Procedure Turns"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007529"></a><a name="_Ref16185245">Intermediate Segments—Procedure Turns</a></h3>

<p>The procedure turn, then, is an intermediate segment&nbsp;procedure 
that enables the pilot to self-navigate to the final approach 
course.&nbsp; The pilot can normally approach the FAF from any 
direction, and then, conforming with the published altitude and heading 
data depicted on an approach plate, manoeuvre the aircraft so that it is
 established on the final approach course, tracking towards the FAF and 
subsequently the runway.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Procedure Turn Variations.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Procedure%2520turn%2520variations.gif"></p>

<p>It is during the procedure turn that the aircraft speed is reduced, 
the prelanding checks completed, and the aircraft established in a 
landing configuration.&nbsp; Once the FAF is crossed, the aircraft 
continues onto the Final Approach Segment toward the runway, and either a
 landing or missed approach is conducted.&nbsp; The above depiction 
shows the four basic procedure turns commonly flown in Canada.&nbsp; 
There are other variations on these basic patterns, but they all 
generally serve the function of getting the aircraft configured on the 
final approach course within predictable distance from the FAF.&nbsp; 
The type of pattern used depends on the position of the aircraft as it 
approaches the FAF—the standard procedure turn, for example, would be 
used by a pilot approach the fix from, in the above example, the eastern
 quadrants, while the racetrack would serve the pilot approaching the 
fix from the eastern quadrants, and so forth.&nbsp; Additional procedure
 turn patterns appears in various IFR publications, and it should be 
noted that names of the procedure turn patterns vary somewhat between 
Canada and the U.S.</p>

<p>It must be kept in mind that procedure-turn manoeuvres are quite 
unlike holds, in that, while hold-entry procedures are specified in the 
CARs, procedure-turn manoeuvres are not.&nbsp; Essentially, there are 
perhaps a dozen different procedures that are practised in Canada and 
the U.S., and the pattern for a procedure-turn manoeuvre is essentially 
at the discretion of the pilot (or the company, in the case of 
commercial IFR operations).&nbsp; There are, however, specified 
parameters for published procedure turns that the pilot must conform to,
 irrespective of the specific pattern flown.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Plan%2520and%2520profile%2520view%2520symbols.gif"></p>

<p><img alt="Sample profile and planview of Instrument Approach Procedure.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Procedure%2520turn%2520variations%25202.gif"></p>

<p>The depictions above provide an example of how procedure turns are 
presented in Canada Air Pilot, and how the parameters are interpreted.</p>

<p>To begin with, note that procedure can only be conducted on one side 
of the specified final approach course.&nbsp; This is indicated by the 
direction of the barb.&nbsp; In this case, the procedure turn must be 
completed to the south of the published final approach course of 090°.</p>

<p>Secondly, note that there is a published limit with respect to the 
distance from the FAF within which the procedure turn must be 
completed.&nbsp; In this case, the manoeuvring must be accomplished no 
further than 10 NM from the Alpha NDB.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, note that the aircraft must remain at or above the published
 minimum altitude during the procedure turn.&nbsp; In this case, the 
aircraft cannot descend below 2500’ ASL until established inbound on a 
090° towards the Alpha NDB.&nbsp; Only when the aircraft is established 
on the final approach course can a descent be commenced to the minimum 
altitude for crossing the FAF (beacon-crossing altitude).&nbsp; As a 
standard reference, note that the procedure-turn depiction includes the 
published 45° offsets from the final approach course—in this case, 045° 
and 225°.&nbsp; The 45° offsets are commonly flown at some point during 
most procedure-turn patterns.</p>

<p>The publication of a procedure turn for an ILS approach appears 
virtually identical to that of an NDB approach indicated above.&nbsp; 
With an ILS approach plate, the depiction includes the glidepath, which 
is projected up from the threshold of the runway.&nbsp; In the case of 
an ILS approach, the pilot does not normally descend below procedure 
altitude until the glideslope is intercepted.&nbsp; In the example shown
 above, it may be noted that there is a localizer-only approach that 
overlays the ILS approach.&nbsp; The dotted line depicts the 
non-precision approach descent using the ILS localizer signal only (with
 glideslope information).&nbsp; For localizer-only approaches, the 
beacon-crossing altitude is published—in the above example, the aircraft
 may descend to 1500’ once established on the final approach 
course.&nbsp; In the case of full ILS approaches (with glideslope 
information), the depiction includes the altitude that an aircraft 
tracking the glideslope should be at when the FAF is crossed—in the 
example above, this altitude is 1700’.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was mentioned above that the initial segment of an instrument 
approach—whether the transition occurs via the MSA or a published 
straight-line transition—that the pilot is assured a 1000’ clearance 
over all vicinity obstacles.&nbsp; In the case of procedure turns—which 
is part of the intermediate segment of an instrument approach—the 
obstacle clearance decreases from 1000’ to 500’.&nbsp; Obviously, 500’ 
over terrain in IMC conditions is not a lot of space, so you can see 
that you have to be rather precise with your instrument 
navigation.&nbsp; You might think that this reduced obstacle clearance 
would be assured within the distance limitations published for the 
procedure turn—say 10 NM—and that this would apply to the entire 
quadrant specified for the procedure turn.&nbsp; Importantly, this is 
not the case.&nbsp; Instead, 500’ obstacle clearance is only assured in 
lopsided oval as depicted on the left.</p>

<p><img alt="IFR Procedure Turn--Protected Area.  Langley Flying School" src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Procedure%252520turn%252520standards%252520for%252520area%252520protec.gif"></p>

<p>The above depiction, then, shows the dimensions of airspace 
surrounding a published procedure turn, outside of which, an aircraft 
must never stray.&nbsp; In this case the procedure turn is left, and 
therefore the aircraft is required to conduct procedure turn manoeuvring
 to the left of the final approach course, and above a line running 
perpendicular to the final approach course through the final approach 
fix.&nbsp; In fact, the shaded area includes a built-in 2-NM buffer 
area, and the primary manoeuvring area is no closer than 2 NM from the 
boundary indicated.&nbsp; The important point to realize is that 
aircraft must be maintained in close proximity of the final approach 
fix, and it is desired that the aircraft is manoeuvred.&nbsp; If an 
aircraft strays outside the limits of protected airspace, the published 
procedure turn altitude will not assure obstacle clearance.</p>

<p>The question arises as to how a pilot in IMC conditions reckons the 
aircraft’s distance from the final approach fix during procedure turn 
manoeuvring.&nbsp; Certainly, distance information provided by GPS or 
DME would be used when available.&nbsp; But the primary tool used is 
time.&nbsp; Even when distance data is available, time is used as a back
 up.&nbsp; If the aircraft is travelling at 120 KTS during procedure 
turn manoeuvring, and the winds are calm, it will pass 2 NM every 
minute.&nbsp; Accordingly, with a 10 NM procedure turn limit, the 
aircraft should travel away from the final approach fix for no more 
than, say, four minutes.&nbsp; It is critical, of course, that 
consideration be given to drift caused by wind.</p>

<p>The question arises as to how procedure-turn information is presented
 in Canada Air Pilot, and there are some subtle, yet important, 
variations to be aware of.</p>

<p>In this regard, consider the published NDB approach for Nanaimo Airport’s Runway 16.</p>

<p><img alt="Nanaimo Airport's NDB 16 approach--sample depiction.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Nanaimo%2520NDB%252016%2520profile%2520and%2520plan%2520view.gif"></p>

<p>As may be noted in the depiction above, the Nanaimo procedure turn 
requires a right turn, rather than the left turn that is normally 
used.&nbsp; Accordingly, based on the position of the procedure turn 
barb, all manoeuvring must be conducted to the west of the 184°/004° 
track.</p>

<p>Also, note that the Nanaimo procedure includes a minimum crossing 
altitude&nbsp;for the final approach fix when entering the procedure 
turn.&nbsp; When a crossing altitude is published, the aircraft must not
 descend to the procedure-turn altitude until the aircraft is 
established on the procedure-turn side of the final approach fix.&nbsp; 
At Nanaimo, then, the aircraft cannot descend to 2000’ until the 
aircraft has passed abeam the fix outbound in the procedure turn.&nbsp; 
With most instrument approaches, however, a minimum crossing altitude is
 not specified, and a pilot may descend to the published procedure turn 
altitude immediately after the fix has been crossed, from any direction.</p>

<p>Lastly, note that the Nanaimo procedure includes a change in the 
final approach course.&nbsp; While the procedure turn is based on the 
184°/004° track, the aircraft must accomplish a course change to 159° 
once the aircraft has crossed the NDB and is proceeding towards the 
runway in the final approach segment.</p>

<p>Another variation in procedure turns occurs when the final approach 
fix is co-located at the airport.&nbsp; In the case of Nanaimo, for 
example, the NDB is located 4.1 NM from the airport, and this is the 
desired approximate location of a FAF—offset from the runway so that a 
final approach segment may be flown.&nbsp; In the case of Powell River, 
however, the NDB is located right at the airport.</p>

<p><img alt="Power River IFR Procedure Turn Depiction.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Powell%252520River%252520with%252520Plan%252520and%252520Profile%252520v.gif"></p>

<p>In the case of Powell River, note that the final-approach fix 
depiction (the cross) is missing.&nbsp; As is the case of all published 
approaches with a co-located FAF, the procedure does not have a final 
approach segment.&nbsp; Note also that there is not a published 
bacon-crossing altitude.&nbsp; Instead, the final altitude reference is 
derived from the minimums box, where, in the case of this approach, the 
aircraft is authorised to descend to 1200’ (Category A and B 
aircraft).&nbsp; This final descent is done once the aircraft has 
completed the procedure turn and is established on the final approach 
course of 080°.</p>

<p><img alt="Sandspit Airport Procedure Turn.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Sandspit.gif"></p>

<p>While it is common for the procedure turn to be anchored on an NDB, 
this is not always the case.&nbsp; With the Sandspit&nbsp;VOR/DME RWY 30
 approach, for example, the FAF is a DME fix—in this case EBGAM fix is 
based on 6 DME from the Sandspit VORTAC on the 123° Radial.&nbsp; In 
transitioning to this approach, consideration would have to be given to 
means by which tracking to EBGAM is accomplished.&nbsp; Without waypoint
 navigation capability—GPS or RNAV—an aircraft could reckon its position
 at EBGAM only after passing the VORTAC and tracking outbound on the 
123° Radial.</p>

<p>On occasion, the procedure turn is conducted on a facility fix other 
than the final approach fix.&nbsp; This is the case with the ILS for 
Cranbrook’s Runway 16.&nbsp; Two NDBs are located on the final-approach 
course for this approach, with the inner NDB, named Cranbrook, being the
 final approach fix, while a second NDB, located more than 16 NM up from
 the final approach fix is the anchor for the procedure turn.</p>

<p><img alt="Cranbrook Airport Procedure Turn Depiction.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Cranbrook%2520plan%2520and%2520profile.gif"></p>

<p>The Cranbrook ILS also demonstrates the differences between precision
 and non-precision approaches.&nbsp; Note how the procedure turn 
provides for a descent to 8100’ prior to crossing the Skookum NDB.&nbsp;
 From this altitude, an aircraft flying the ILS intercepts the 
glideslope and begins the continuous descent down to the runway 
threshold along the 3° glideslope.&nbsp; In the case of the 
non-precision localizer approach, an aircraft crossing Skookum can then 
descend down to 5300’.&nbsp; This altitude, in turn, is maintained until
 Cranbrook is crossed, after which the aircraft can descent to the 
published MDA.</p>

<p>A final note concerns RNAV-GPS approaches.&nbsp; GPS approaches do 
not have procedure turns.&nbsp; Instead of manoeuvring the aircraft for 
interception of the final-approach course by reference to the 
final-approach fix, or a secondary facility or fix, as is the case with 
the Cranbrook ILS, the aircraft proceeds to one of the three waypoints 
which surround the final-approach course, and from one of these 
waypoints to another waypoint located on the final-approach course 
outside the final approach fix.&nbsp; The approach therefore appears 
alike a cross, with the long center post being the final approach 
course.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Cross Depiction associated with RNAV GPS Approaches.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/GPS%2520Cross.gif"></p>

<p>GPS approaches differ in that a pilot preparing for the procedures 
does not tune, identify, and set the various navigation aids that make 
up a conventional instrument approach.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">3</a>&nbsp;
 Instead, the waypoints that compose the GPS approach are loaded from 
the internal memory of the GPS black box.&nbsp; To load, the pilot first
 selects the airport, and then, in the case of multiple GPS approaches, 
selects the one intended to fly.&nbsp; Once the particular approach is 
selected, the pilot must then select the initial fix from which the 
final approach course will be navigated to.</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Langley%2520Plan%2520View.gif"></p>

<p>Above is a depiction of the RNAV GPS A approach for Langley 
Airport.&nbsp; The cross-shaped layout is based on the CHAIT, HOLES, and
 MIXAX Waypoints, with an additional transition route being provided 
between MIXAX and the Whatcom VORTAC.&nbsp; Once an approach clearance 
is received, the pilot can descend to the minimum altitudes published 
for each of these transition routes.&nbsp; After the first transition 
fix is entered the GPS incorporates the waypoints that make up the 
transition into the active flight plan of the GPS, and as the aircraft 
progresses through the transition, the GPS automatically cycles through 
the waypoints in the correct sequence.&nbsp; Interestingly, the rule for
 IFR approved GPS systems is that the pilot cannot manually select the 
waypoints that make up the approach procedure; instead, the approach 
(and transition) must be selected and loaded as a single entity or unit.</p>

<p>Another feature of GPS approaches is turn anticipation.&nbsp; The 90°
 turn that appears on the MIXAX transition, for example, when turning 
onto the final approach course at BANQS would not be seen on a 
conventional instrument approach.&nbsp;&nbsp; The GPS black box makes 
this turn possible, however, because it instructs the pilot when to 
begin a 20°-banked turn onto the final approach course.&nbsp; The GPS 
anticipates the turn.</p>

<p>A final note relates to the missed approach.&nbsp; The GPS does not 
automatically sequence to the first missed-approach waypoint&nbsp;until 
the pilot instructs it to do so.&nbsp; This is, or course, to enable the
 pilot to radio-navigate with reference to the missed-approach point—in 
the case of Langley, LANCK—during the manoeuvring for a landing in what 
could be marginal weather conditions.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">1</a> A third type of 
precision approach—MLS for Microwave Landing System—was pursued by 
Transport Canada for a brief period some years ago, but has essentially 
been phased out of service.&nbsp; MLS still appears in US approach 
publications.&nbsp; With respect to PAR approaches, these only appear at
 military airports in Canada are therefore not generally relevant to 
Canadian civil aviation.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">2</a> Flying an ILS 
instrument approach, for example, requires that the display for the 
localizer and glideslope are properly tuned and identified, with the 
final approach course selected, and that the FAF---typically an NDB—is 
also properly tuned and identified.</p>

<a id="Intermediate Segments—Intermediate Fixes"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007530"></a><a name="_Ref177255523"></a><a name="_Ref177255510">Intermediate Segments—Intermediate Fixes</a></h3>

<p>On occasion, a straight-line transition provided in the initial 
segment leads to a fix that is located on the final-approach course with
 sufficient distance from the FAF such that a procedure turn is not 
required.&nbsp; The fix associated with these types of straight-line 
transitions is said to be the Intermediate Fix (IF), and the 
intermediate segment that follows—rather than entailing a procedure 
turn—simply requires straight-in tracking from the IF to the FAF, and 
thence straight-in to the runway threshold.&nbsp; This by-passing of the
 procedure turn is shown below.</p>

<p><img alt="Straight-in transition to Intermediate Fix.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Straight-line%2520transition%2520to%2520intermediate%2520fix.gif"></p>

<p>An example of Intermediate Fix that permits a straight-in 
Intermediate Segment is the NDB 07 approach at Abbotsford, depicted 
below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Intermediate Fix associated with the Abbotsford Instrument Aproach.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/White%2520Rock%2520IF.gif"></p>

<p>The symbol for an Intermediate Fix (IF) varies somewhat, but it is 
likely to be a short “crossing” line that is perpendicular to the final 
approach course.&nbsp; In the case of the Abbotsford NDB approach, for 
example, the IF symbol is located directly over the White Rock 
NDB.&nbsp; As can be seen, the White Rock NDB is also a 
Waypoint—indicated by the waypoint symbol; this appears as the 
Abbotsford NDB approach is also authorised for GPS overlay.&nbsp; Not 
also that the approach at Abbotsford is explicit with the notation “No 
PT” (for “No Procedure Turn”) referenced by an arrow just outside the 
procedure turn symbol&nbsp;(the 45° offset “barb”).</p>

<p>A pilot planning the Abbotsford NDB 07 approach therefore has the 
option of proceeding directly to the XX NDB and performing a procedure 
turn, or—alternately—proceeding to the WC NDB, and from there tracking 
167° directly to the XX NDB for a straight-in approach.</p>

<p>In fact, the appearance of an IF on an NDB-only approach is not very 
common.&nbsp; More often they appear in conjunction with DME facilities 
located on the ground, and they are frequently found on ILS approaches 
where DME is required.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">1</a>&nbsp; By way of example, consider the ILS/DME approach published for Cranbrook, which appears below:</p>

<p><img alt="Cranbrook Airports Intermediate Fix.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Cranbrook%2520Transitions.gif">.</p>

<p>The IF named CHUCK appears on the Cranbrook’s ILS/DME RWY 16, but it 
is not featured on the ILS-only approach also published for Runway 16.</p>

<p>The transition to CHUCK is anchored on the Cranbrook VOR.&nbsp; From 
here, the 002° Radial is tracked for 24 DME (NM), where the aircraft is 
positioned at MILAN.&nbsp; Note that MILAN is formally noted as the 
Initial Approach Fix (IAF), but the Cranbrook VOR is also technically an
 IAF—that is, a fix that forms part of the Initial Segment for the 
approach.&nbsp; From MILAN, the pilot steers 088° to intercept the ILS 
Localizer.&nbsp; CHUCK is located further down the 
Localizer—specifically, 16.1 DME from the IXC.&nbsp; Caution must be 
used to differentiate the two DME transmitters that apply to the MILAN 
transition—MILAN is defined using the Cranbrook VOR/DME (noted as 
Channel 58), while CHUCK is defined using the ILS/DME (noted as Channel 
40).&nbsp; A special notation appears on the plate warning the pilot of 
possible confusion in this regard.</p>

<p>Note that a procedure turn is not authorised on ILS/DME 16—apparent 
because the 45°-offset barb does not appear.&nbsp; The procedure-turn 
barb does appear on the ILS-only plate for Cranbrook, and other than the
 MILAN transition and CHUCK as the IF, the two approaches—the ILS/DME 
and the ILS-only—really do not differ.</p>

<p>The notation “IF” appears on all approach plates with an Intermediate
 Fix, but it fact multiple Intermediate Fixes can be located along a 
single final approach course for an approach.&nbsp; If more than one IF 
is featured on the final approach course, these will only be indicated 
by the crossing lines.&nbsp; In the case of Cranbrook, for example, a 
second IF appears at 19 DME—the “crossing line” is apparent abeam the 
notation.&nbsp; Multiple IF positions appear prominently on the ILS 09 
approach for Victoria—no less than three: BRANY, 11 DME, and 7 DME.</p>

<a id="Intermediate Segments—DME Arcs"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007531">Intermediate Segments—DME Arcs</a></h3>

<p>In order for a DME arc transition&nbsp;to exist in an approach 
procedure, the airport must be equipped with both VOR and DME 
facilities.&nbsp; A DME arc is essentially the same as a straight-line 
transition track leading to an IF, except that the pilot flying an arc 
must navigate a curved course published at a specified distance from the
 DME transmitter.</p>

<p><img alt="Sandspit Airport's DME Arc.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Sandspit%2520VOR%2520DME%2520Rwy%252012.gif"></p>

<p>Above is a depiction of the published 15 DME arc for the VOR/DME 
Runway 12 approach at Sandspit Airport.&nbsp; The beginning of the arc 
is defined by a published radial—in the case of the Sandspit VOR/DME 
Runway 12, the arc begins on the 108° Radial—and the end of the arc is 
defined by the Lead Radial (LR)—in the case of Sandspit, the 303° 
Radial.&nbsp; The arc transition for Sandspit has a published minimum 
altitude—2700’ ASL, and a descent to this altitude can be initiated once
 the aircraft is established on the arc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Specifically, navigation to an arc transition is accomplished by 
tracking an intercepting radial either inbound or outbound from the 
anchoring VOR.&nbsp; As the specified DME is approached—15 DME in this 
case, in the case of Sandspit—the aircraft is turned 90° in the 
direction of the arc.&nbsp; Once the CDI indicates a 10° deflection (see
 below), the course is altered 20° inward to the centre of the 
arc.&nbsp; Simultaneously, the OBS (in the case of a conventional VOR 
display) or the Course Selector (in the case of an HSI) is adjusted 20° 
in the direction of travel along the arch.&nbsp; The CDI will show full 
in the opposite direction.&nbsp; When the CDI migrates across the 
display, to again show 20° travel along the arc, the heading of the 
aircraft is again altered 20° toward the centre of air.&nbsp; This 
process of 20° heading change for 20° of arc-travel, is repeated until 
the lead radial&nbsp;is crossed.&nbsp; With lead-radial crossing, the 
aircraft is turned inward to intercept the final approach course.&nbsp; 
In the case of Sandspit, the lead radial is published as the 303° 
radial.</p>

<p><img alt="DME Arc Procedures, Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/DME%2520Procedures.gif"></p>

<p>Throughout the process, the pilot monitors the DME reading.&nbsp; If 
drift is evident by excessive deviation off the target DME reading, the 
change in heading can be done early or deferred, as the situation may 
warrant.&nbsp; At first this process might appear extremely complicated,
 but in fact it is quite simple to fly once you have a little practice.</p>

<p>DME arcs are also provided for on IFR GPS systems, but instead of 
using the radials for reference in the turning sequence, the GPS black 
box presents the arc as a series of waypoints.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">1</a> Another example of an
 NDB approach where an IF exists is Nanaimo.&nbsp; Here you will see the
 IF named ARMAC on both the NDB 16 and NDB/DME 16 approaches.&nbsp; 
ARMAC is defined using 264° Radial off Vancouver’s VORTAC.</p>

<a id="Final-Approach Segment"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007532">Final-Approach Segment</a></h3>

<p>The final-approach segment begins at the final-approach fix, and 
extends to the missed-approach point (MAP).&nbsp; The final-approach fix
 is located on the published final-approach course, and it is along this
 track towards the runway threshold that assured obstacle clearance is 
reduced in some instances to only 200’.</p>

<p>Some approaches lack a final approach fix, and instead, the 
navigation aid on which the approach procedure is anchored is co-located
 at the airport.&nbsp; Such approaches (see Power River) essentially 
lack a final approach segment, and the descent to the Minimum Descent 
Altitude (MDA) is conducted at the end of the procedure turn when the 
aircraft is established on the final approach course.&nbsp; These two 
variations are depicted below.</p>

<p><img alt="Final Approach Segments. Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Final%2520Approach%2520Segment.gif"></p>

<p>With respect to precision approaches (ILS),&nbsp; the aircraft is 
typically set up in a landing configuration by the time the FAF is 
crossed.&nbsp; The final-approach segment is therefore simply flown with
 the intent of maintaining the glidepath and localizer 
indications.&nbsp; At minimums (DH), the aircraft and pilot are ready 
for touchdown.&nbsp; Importantly, if satisfactory visual reference to 
the landing area is not established at minimums, physics require that 
the aircraft will continue for a few seconds in its descent, and the 
aircraft will descend below the published DH, but it can only continue 
though DH provided the pilot is in the act of discontinuing the 
descent—i.e., the pilot is below DH only for the purpose of initiating a
 missed approach.&nbsp; Put in another way, when weather is below 
minimums, the only reason why a pilot should go below DH is for the 
purpose of conducting an overshoot for the missed approach, and even 
then it should only be for a second or two.</p>

<p><img alt="Minimum Descent Altitude and Decision Height.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/MDA%2520and%2520DH.gif"></p>

<p>In the case of non-precision approaches (NDB, VOR, LOC, etc.), it is 
not uncommon for the aircraft to be configured at reduced speed in level
 flight when the FAF is crossed—the pilot having established the 
aircraft level at the FAF-crossing altitude.&nbsp; When the FAF is 
crossed, the final-approach segment typically begins with the pilot 
immediately initiating the last descent down to the MDA.&nbsp; If 
adequate visual reference to the landing area is not established by the 
time the pilot approaches MDA, the aircraft must be once again levelled 
off at a reduced manoeuvring speed that is similar to what is normally 
flown in the downwind leg during a visual landing.&nbsp; There is a 
critical difference—and this is important—between DH, for a precision 
approach, and MDA, for a non-precision approach.&nbsp; The following 
notation appears under Landing Minima in CAP GEN:</p>

<p>CAR 602 specifies that landings are governed by published 
DH/MDA’s.&nbsp; Pilots of aircraft on instrument approaches are 
prohibited from continuing the descent below DH, or descending below 
MDA, as applicable, unless the required visual reference is established 
and maintained in order to complete a safe landing.&nbsp; When the 
required visual reference is not established or maintained, a missed 
approach must be initiated.&nbsp; Missed approaches initiated beyond the
 MAP may not be assured obstacle clearance.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">1</a></p>

<p>This section of the CAP-GEN goes on to specify recommended visual references:</p>

<p>The visual references required by the pilot in order to continue the 
approach to a safe landing should include at least one of the following 
references for the intended runway and should be distinctly visible and 
identifiable to the pilotthe runway or runway markings;</p>

<ul><li>the runway threshold or threshold markings;</li>
	<li>the TDZ or TDZ markings;</li>
	<li>the approach lights;</li>
	<li>the approach slope indicator system;</li>
	<li>the runway identification lights (RILS);</li>
	<li>the threshold and runway end lights;</li>
	<li>the touchdown zone lights (TDZL);</li>
	<li>the parallel runway edge lights; or the runway centerline lights.</li>
</ul><p>Keep in mind that these visual references are recommended.</p>

<a id="Straight-in Approaches"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007533">Straight-in Approaches</a></h3>

<p>Flying down a glidepath to the published DH is one form of a 
straight-in approach.&nbsp; If visual reference to the runway is made, 
the landing is completed, and if the visual reference is not acquired, 
the pilot of the aircraft initiates the published missed-approach 
procedure, and safely climbs away from terrain.&nbsp; In the case of 
non-precision approach, there is not a DH, but there is instead a Missed
 Approach Point&nbsp;(MAP).&nbsp; At the MAP, the pilot initiates the 
climb away from the MDA and begins the missed-approach procedure.&nbsp; 
Let us now examine a couple of examples of how missed-approach points 
are set out for non-precision approaches.</p>

<p><img alt="Colocation of an NDB at an Airport--Powell River.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Powell%2520River--co-located%2520NDB%2520Profile%2520view.gif"></p>

<p>On some approach procedures the MAP is simply defined by the passage 
of a navigation aid.&nbsp; This is the case, for example, at Powell 
River, where the primary navigation fix for the procedure is co-located 
at the airport.&nbsp; Indication of the MAP in these types of approaches
 is provided in the profile view of the approach.&nbsp; The flat line at
 the bottom of the descent shows the routing of the aircraft at the MDA 
along the final approach course.&nbsp; When the NDB is crossed, the 
solid line is replaced by a dashed line, which depicts the aircraft in a
 climb as per the missed approach procedure—in the case of Powell River,
 the pilot must initiate a climbing right turn to a heading of 260°, and
 this heading is to be maintained until the aircraft reaches 
2700’.&nbsp; After reaching 2700’, the a second right turn is conducted,
 and the aircraft is to proceed directly to the Powell River NDB, 
maintaining 3900.’</p>

<p>The majority of approach procedures use time to define the MAP.&nbsp;
 Based on the estimated groundspeed of the aircraft, the final-approach 
segment is timed to predict when the aircraft will arrive at the 
threshold of the runway.&nbsp; In the case of Nanaimo, for example, an 
aircraft travelling at a groundspeed of 110 KTS will require 2 minutes 
and 14 seconds to fly the distance of 4.1 NM that lies between the FAF 
and the threshold of Runway 16.</p>

<p><img alt="Missed Approach Point for the Nanaimo Airport Runway 16 Approach.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Nanaimo%2520approach%2520%2520MAP%2520based%2520on%2520time.gif"></p>

<p>Obviously, the wind must be factored in if the determination of the 
MAP is to be accurate (and you want accurate).&nbsp; If the same 
aircraft is flying a headwind component of 10 KTS, it will require only 2
 minutes and 29 seconds.&nbsp; The correction for wind must be factored 
in as accurately as possible, even though there is no assurance that the
 winds on the surface will be the same as the winds at the MDA.</p>

<p>Another factor to consider is the time at which the pilot should 
first look up from the instrument panel to check for visual 
reference.&nbsp; For the purpose of manoeuvring the aircraft for 
landing, a pilot might first look for visual reference approximately one
 minute back from the threshold.&nbsp; Accordingly, if the aircraft is 
travelling at a groundspeed of 110 KTS, the pilot should check for 
visual reference at approximately 1 minute, 14 seconds.</p>

<p><img alt="Terrace Airport and the use of DME in defining the Missed Approach Point.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Terrace%2520MAP%2520based%2520on%2520DME.gif"></p>

<p>The Terrace&nbsp;LOC/DME B is different from the Powell River or 
Nanaimo approaches because DME alone is used to define the MAP.&nbsp; As
 can be seen, the published procedure for Terrace is similar to the 
Power River approach in that the times and distance box is blank.&nbsp; 
Instead, the pilot must look to the profile view of the approach, as 
well as the missed approach description, where the MAP is defined as .8 
DME.&nbsp; Note also that the distance defined by DME is different from 
the distance measurements to the threshold (you don’t want to confuse 
the two).&nbsp; In fact, the DME transmitter is co-located with the 
localizer and fan marker at the departure off the departure end of the 
runway.</p>

<p>It is interesting that this approach does not provide a lot of time 
at the MDA to spot the runway.&nbsp; If the aircraft leaves the altitude
 at which 2.5 DME must be crossed—1700’—and descends down to the MDA of 
1240’ at 1000’ per minutes, this will take about 30 seconds.&nbsp; 
During that 30 seconds, an aircraft with a groundspeed of 120 KTS will 
cross about 1 NM, leaving only 20 seconds at the MDA in level 
flight.&nbsp; Considering the precious seconds it takes to set level 
flight, you can see why this approach is designated not as a straight-in
 approach, but only as a circling approach.</p>

<a id="Circling for Landing"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007534">Circling for Landing</a></h3>

<p>In fact there are two additional variations related to the 
final-approach segment.&nbsp; On the one hand, a published procedure may
 provide for a straight-in approach, whereby the final-approach course 
is adequately aligned with the runway intended for landing; on the other
 hand, however, a circling&nbsp;manoeuvre may be required.</p>

<p><img alt="Circling Minima for Powell River Airport.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Powell%2520River%2520Circling%2520minimum.gif"></p>

<p>There are two general reasons why a pilot might fly a circling 
manoeuvre, rather than a straight-in approach.&nbsp; First, the pilot 
may not have a choice—straight-in minimum may simply not be published 
for the runway intended for landing.&nbsp; This is the case, for 
example, with NDB A at Powell River depicted above.&nbsp; The layout of 
this approach at Powell River does not conform with the more stringent 
requirements for straight-in instrument approach procedures.&nbsp; Thus,
 this approach is designated alphabetically—the NDB “A”—rather than 
using the runway identification number, which is the case with the NDB 
07 at Abbotsford where a straight-in approach is provided.</p>

<p><img alt="Power River IFR minimum.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Port%252520Hardy%252520VOR%252520DME%252520Rwy%25252025%252520minimum%2525.gif"></p>

<p>The second reason why a circling manoeuvre is performed, however, is 
not because of limiting features of the approach layout, but simply 
because the pilot may elect to do an approach on one runway, yet land at
 another at the same airport.&nbsp; For the most part, the published 
minima box provides a circling option for every approach that has an 
approved straight-in manoeuvre.&nbsp; This the case, for example, with 
the VOR/DME RWY 25 approach at Port Hardy (above), as well as the ILS 
RWY 16 at Cranbrook (below).</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Cranbrook%2520minima.gif"></p>

<p>Note that the rule for prohibited descent below applies to circling 
manoeuvres performed off&nbsp; ILS procedures—the aircraft leaves the 
glidepath at the MDA (in the case of Cranbrook, 3708’), and does not 
descend below this until a safe landing is assured.</p>

<p>There are two additional points that are important to know with 
respect to circling manoeuvres.&nbsp; The first relates to the rather 
tight limits for terrain and obstacle clearance.&nbsp; The posted MDA 
for a circling manoeuvre&nbsp;provides only 300’ clearance over 
obstacles within a small radius around the runway surfaces of an 
airport.&nbsp; That leaves not a lot of space between the aircraft and 
obstacles when the aircraft is being manoeuvred for landing.</p>

<p><img alt="SPEC VIS Aircraft Categories.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Aircraft%252520categories%252520for%252520circling%252520with%252520ar.gif"></p>

<p>The table above outlines the arc radii within which the 300’ obstacle
 clearance is assured.&nbsp; The categories, as you can see, are 
identical to those used for SPEC VIS determination, and they are 
similarly based on the speed at which the aircraft is to be 
manoeuvred.&nbsp; As in the case with SPEC VIS manoeuvre speeds, it is 
important to remember that the manoeuvring speed for circling are not 
necessarily fixed for aircraft.&nbsp; In the case of Cranbrook, for 
example, an aircraft flying a straight-in localizer approach for Runway 
16—in which the MDA is governed by circling minima—can be reduced to a 
much lower manoeuvring speed, when compared to the same aircraft that 
conducts the localizer for Runway 16, but has to circle for landing on 
Runway 34.&nbsp; In the case of the straight-in approach, the aircraft 
might meet Category A requirements, but in the case of circling for the 
reciprocal runway, the manoeuvring speed required might boost the 
aircraft up to Category B.&nbsp; Granted, there is not a lot of speed 
variation to play with, but it is nevertheless important to remember the
 tight parameters associated with obstacle-clearance protection during 
circling manoeuvres.</p>

<p>The protected radius for a circling manoeuvre—as set out by the 
categories listed above—is based on distance from the runway thresholds 
that exist at the airport.&nbsp; As depicted below, an arc is projected 
from each runway threshold, and the limits for manoeuvring are 
determined from the position of these arcs, as well as the tangent lines
 jointing them.</p>

<p><img alt="Visual Maneuvering Area for IFR circling maneuvers.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Visual%2520Maneuvering%2520Area%2520for%2520Circling.gif"></p>

<p>A second important thing to remember about circling manoeuvres is the
 possibility of circling restrictions.&nbsp; In the depiction for the 
Port Hardy&nbsp;VOR/DME Runway 25, note the circling restrictions that 
limit any circling to the to the north and east of the Runway 29/11 
centerline.&nbsp; These sorts of restriction are common, especially in 
mountainous areas.</p>

<p>The patterns commonly used for a circling manoeuvre are outlined 
below.&nbsp; The pilot has latitude with respect to the pattern flown, 
so flexibility is built in.&nbsp; Unless there are restrictions, pilots 
prefer to circle clockwise so as to permit the best pilot-view of the 
landing areas.</p>

<p>Making a landing with limited visual reference is a tricky business, 
and you should be especially aware of illusions&nbsp;that may be 
associated with the landing environment.&nbsp; These are outlined below.</p>

<p>Just a final word on GPS approaches.&nbsp; For the most part, GPS 
minima are depicted identical to non-GPS minima, but there are some 
variations to point out.&nbsp; First, the profile view of the final 
approach segments often contains a series of waypoints, defined by GPS, 
which enable the pilot to reckon the progress of the aircraft during the
 approach and descent.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Profile view of the IFR approach at Langley Airport.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Langley%2520proflie%2520view.gif"></p>

<p>Langley appears above, and you can see that the final approach 
segment is made of up four wapoints—Banqs, Kluck, Levir, and Lanck—each 
with a different designation.&nbsp; BANQS has the designation of the 
IWP, which is the Intermediate Waypoint; because it is located on the 
final approach course, it has the same status as a standard Initial Fix 
(see p. 148).&nbsp; The next waypoint is KLUCK (the “chicken fix”), and 
is designated the FAWP—the Final Approach Waypint, identical to a Final 
Approach Fix.&nbsp; LEVIR is next, and it is designated SDWP which 
abbreviates Step-down Waypoint.&nbsp; When KLUCK is crossed, the pilot 
can only descent initially to 1300’, but once LEVIR is crossed, the 
pilot can step-down the published MDA of 680’.&nbsp; The last 
waypoint—LANCK—maps the end of the final approach segment and designates
 the point at which a lack of visual reference with the runway requires a
 missed approach; it is therefore the MAWP—the Missed Approach Waypoint.</p>

<p>The Langley RNAV A is obviously a circling approach in that there are
 no straight-in minima published, and instead “circling” appears in the 
minima box.&nbsp; This is a good time to look at straight-in RNAV 
approaches, which contain, as you would expect, a bunch of 
acronyms.&nbsp; Below is the RNAV approach for RWY 09 at Victoria:</p>

<p>In the profile view, the waypoint designation are recognizably 
identical to Langley—IWP, SDWP, FAWP, AND MAWP—but in the minima box, 
however, we now see provision for LNAV/VNAV, LNAV, and, finally, 
circling.&nbsp; LNAV/VNAV refers to WAAS capabilities (see P. 54).&nbsp;
 Of course, this Victoria approach, as is the case with most GPS 
approaches in Canada, does not have WAAS facility and the LNAV/VNAV are 
not authorized nor published.&nbsp; The GPS lateral navigation 
minimum—LNAV—is published.</p>

<p><img alt="Victoria RNAV GPS approach.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Victoria%2520GPS%2520profile%2520view.gif"></p>

<a id="Missed Approach Segment"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007536">Missed Approach Segment</a></h3>

<p>The missed approach segment is considered to be the most critical 
part of an instrument approach.&nbsp; Perhaps most significantly, the 
workload is high in a missed approach, as the configuration of the 
aircraft must be changed (approach to overshoot), and a new sequence of 
navigation instructions must followed.</p>

<p>One of the greatest hazards associated with conducting a missed 
approach is referred to as the pitch-up illusion.&nbsp; When the 
aircraft is established on approach, the forces acting on the 
otoliths—hair-shaped cells in the inner ear that provides sensory 
information related to acceleration—provides the sensation of stabilized
 speed, based primarily on the forces of gravity.&nbsp; When 
acceleration occurs, as is the case when a missed approach is conducted 
and the aircraft accelerates from approach speed to climb speed, there 
are now two forces at work—gravity and acceleration.&nbsp; The danger is
 that the brain is prone to incorrectly resolve the two forces as a 
single pitch-up movement.&nbsp; The pilot then feels that the aircraft 
is climbing when, in fact, it remains in level flight:</p>

<p>The brain resolves the two forces (gravity and acceleration) as a 
single resultant force acting downward and backward.&nbsp; We have 
learned to interpret such a force as the head being tilted backwards, so
 the pilot feels that the nose of the aircraft is pitching up.&nbsp; In 
normal conditions the sensations are correcedt by vision . . (Without 
visual reference, the) normal reaction to (the pitch-up illusion) is to 
push forward on the stick.&nbsp; Accident report from such cases often 
state “. . the aircraft struck the ground at a steep angle on the runway
 heading.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">1</a></p>

<p>Missed approach procedures are designed to be as simple as possible, 
yet it is considered crucial for the pilot to become conversant with the
 missed approach procedure before the approach sequence begins.&nbsp; 
There are a few important factors to consider.</p>

<p>Only one missed-approach procedure exists on an approach plate, but alternate missed-approach procedures may be issued by ATC.</p>

<p>There is an effort made in the design of missed approach procedures 
to avoid initial turns, but when a initial turn is specified, the pilot 
should begin the turning manoeuvre as soon as possible after a positive 
climb rate has been established.</p>

<p>Specified routings and altitudes must be strictly adhered to.&nbsp; Consider the following:</p>

<p>CLIMB 020° TO CROSS “X” NDB AT OR ABOVE 1300 FT.&nbsp; RIGHT TURN AT “X”&nbsp; NDB TO 090° CLIMBING TO 2100 FT.</p>

<p>The pilot must, in this case, proceed via X-ray NDB regardless of 
where 1300 ft is reached.&nbsp; If no turning point is specified, the 
pilot may begin the turn as soon as the aircraft reaches the specified 
turning altitude.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">2</a></p>

<p>If it is ever required that a missed approach be initiated before the
 MAP is reached, the aircraft must be flown to the MAP along the final 
approach course before the specified procedures are followed.&nbsp; 
Hence the importance of timing the MAP on an ILS approach—if an aircraft
 must climb away from the glidepath before the MAP, only time can be 
used to predict when the MAP is reached.</p>

<p>In the event that a missed approach must be initiated during a circling procedure, the following are the recommended procedures:</p>

<ul><li>initiate a climb;</li>
	<li>turn the aircraft toward the centre of the airport;</li>
	<li>conform as closely as possible to the missed approach procedure published for the instrument approach just completed.</li>
</ul><a id="Arrival Communications and Procedures"></a><h2><a name="_Toc179007537">Arrival Communications and Procedures</a></h2>

<a id="STARs"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007538">STARs</a></h3>

<p>As a means of simplifying clearance procedures, Standard Terminal 
Arrival (STAR) procedures are published for designated airports and are 
published in CAP/JEP.</p>

<p>Pilots are not required to accept a STAR clearance, and if any doubt exists the pilot should request a detailed clearance.</p>

<a id="Profile Descents"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007539">Profile Descents</a></h3>

<p>Profile Descents&nbsp;are used in conjunction with STARs at congested airports and are also published in CAP/JEP.</p>

<p>Profile Descents are designed to permit aircraft to undertake 
uninterrupted descents as a destination airport is approached, and 
therefore contain vertical navigation instructions.</p>

<p>If ATC revises an altitude depicted in a Profile Descent, all remaining portions of the Profile Descent are cancelled.</p>

<p>In the case of changes in ATC speed assignments, however, charted 
altitudes are not affected and the Profile Descent altitudes must still 
be complied with.</p>

<p>Profile Descents do not constitute approach authorisation; instead 
the last “maintain (altitude)” depicted in the PD chart remains as the 
last ATC assigned altitude.</p>

<a id="Approach Ban"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007540">Approach Ban</a></h3>

<p>When an approach ban exists, pilots are prohibited from completing an
 instrument approach beyond the FAF, or beyond the point at which the 
final approach course is intercepted where a FAF does not exist.&nbsp; 
This ban is in effect whenever RVR values (for discussions regarding 
RVR, see P. 240) go below 1200’, or in some cases, 600’</p>

<p>The only exceptions to the approach ban are as follows:</p>

<ul><li>the below-minima RVR report is received, the aircraft is inbound
 on approach and has passed the FAF, or where there is no FAF, the point
 where the final approach course is intercepted;</li>
	<li>the Pilot-in-command has informed the appropriate ATC unit that the
 aircraft is on a training flight and that the Pilot-in-command intends 
to initiate a missed approach procedure at or above the DH or the MDA, 
as appropriate;</li>
	<li>the RVR is varying between distances less than and greater than the minimum RVR;</li>
	<li>the RVR is less than the minimum RVR, and the ground visibility at 
the aerodrome where the runway is located is reported to be at least 
one-quarter statute mile; or</li>
	<li>the Pilot-in-command is conducting a precision approach to CAT III minima.</li>
</ul><p>The AIM states as follows:</p>

<p>With respect to approach restrictions, in the case of a localized 
phenomenon or any fluctuations that affect RVR validity, where the 
ground visibility is reported by ATC or FSS to be at or above 
one-quarter statute mile, an approach may be completed (RAC 9.19.2.1).</p>

<a id="Approach Clearance"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007541">Approach Clearance</a></h3>

<p>If the approach is to be made in uncontrolled airspace where there is
 a published approach procedure, ATC will clear the aircraft out of 
controlled airspace vertically via the published procedure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unless pilots inform ATC that they are aware of the current ATIS, ATC
 will provide the ceiling, visibility, wind, runway, altimeter setting, 
and the approach in use immediately prior to or shortly after the issue 
of a descent clearance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Generally, it is useful to speak of two types of ATC approach 
clearance.&nbsp; The first type is when the approach procedure is 
specified by ATC in the approach clearance.&nbsp; The second type is 
when ATC clears an aircraft for an approach but does not specify the 
procedure to be used—this may be referred to as an “open” approach 
clearance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td>
			<p>ATC:</p>

			<td>
			<p>“Cleared to the AbbotsfordAirport via the ILS 07 approach, ABC.”</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			</td>
		</tr></tbody></table><p>When ATC issues a specific approach clearance,
 the published name of the approach will be used, indicating that 
adherence to a particular procedure is required.&nbsp; If visual 
conditions are established prior to the completion of the procedure, the
 pilot should nevertheless continue and complete the entire procedure 
unless further clearance is obtained.</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td>
			<p>ATC:</p>

		</tr></tbody></table><p>In the event that an approach is to flown on 
one runway, yet a landing is to flown on a second runway not aligned 
with the instrument-approach aid being used, the number of the runway 
that is to be used for the landing will be included in the approach 
clearance.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">2</a> Instrument Procedures Manual, P. 4-45.</p>

<a id="“Open” Approach Clearance"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007542">“Open” Approach Clearance</a></h3>

<p>Where traffic is light, ATC may issue clearances that do not specify the type of approach.&nbsp; For example:</p>

<p>ATC:&nbsp; “ABC, you are cleared to AbbotsfordAirport for an approach.”</p>

<p>In these cases, the pilot has the option of proceeding via the route 
initially cleared by ATC in a previous clearance, by any published 
transition or feeder route associated with a selected procedure, or by a
 route that is direct to the fix associated with the selected approach 
procedure.&nbsp; Pilots choosing to proceed to the instrument-procedure 
fix via a route that is off an airway, air route, or transition are 
responsible for maintaining the appropriate obstacle clearance, 
complying with noise abatement procedures, and for remaining clear of 
Class F airspace.&nbsp; As soon as practicable after receipt of this 
kind of approach, it is the pilot’s responsibility to advise ATC of the 
type of published instrument approach procedure to be used, the landing 
runway and the intended route to be flown.</p>

<p>An open approach clearance does not provide the pilot with the 
authority to conduct a contact or visual approach instead, these 
procedures (which essentially permit the pilot to deviate from the 
published procedure) must be specifically requested by the pilot.</p>

<a id="Frequency Change and Descents"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007543">Frequency Change and Descents</a></h3>

<p>When changing frequency to FSS or Tower unit, the pilot should advise
 ATC the intended route and published instrument-approach procedure 
being conducted.&nbsp; For example,</p>

<p>“AbbotsfordTower this is GABC with you on the full procedure NDB 07.”</p>

<p>After the issue and acknowledgement of an approach clearance, and if 
an initial altitude restriction is not included in the clearance, the 
pilot may descend when convenient to whichever is the lowest of the 
following IFR altitudes as they apply to the aircraft’s position:</p>

<ul><li>MEA;</li>
	<li>any published transition or feeder route altitude;</li>
	<li>Minimum Sector Altitude (MSA), as specified on the instrument approach chart;</li>
	<li>safe altitude 100 NM as specified on the instrument approach chart;</li>
	<li>when in airspace where a higher minimum is not published as above, an altitude that conforms with MOCA.</li>
</ul><p>Special Note:</p>

<p>Prior to initiating one of the above descents, the pilot must be 
positively assured of the aircraft’s position, using a reference 
bearing, radial, DME, radar, or by visual means.</p>

<a id="Descending out of Controlled Airspace"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007544">Descending out of Controlled Airspace</a></h3>

<p>In controlled airspace, ATC will not clear an aircraft to operate 
below the MEA of an airway (when operating on an airway) or below the 
minimum published IFR altitude in areas other than an airway.&nbsp; 
However, to descend to an airport below controlled airport, the pilot 
can request to operate at MOCA and make arrangements with ATC to reserve
 and protect the MEA in the event that the descent to MOCA does not give
 rise to VMC conditions.&nbsp; If this arrangement is made, ATC will 
protect the MEA in accordance with the following:</p>

<ul><li>until the pilot files an arrival report with ATC;</li>
	<li>for 30 minutes (thereby allowing time for a descent to the MOCA and
 a return climb to the MEA where communication with ATC can be 
restored);</li>
	<li>or, if ATC does not hear from the pilot, until the aircraft’s ETA at the destination airport plus an additional 30 minutes.</li>
</ul><a id="Minimum Weather Conditions"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007545">Minimum Weather Conditions</a></h3>

<p>In the event that an instrument approach is conducted when there is a
 low probability of success owing to weather being at or below minimums,
 the pilot should facilitate ATC planning by providing advance notice of
 intentions in the event of a missed approach.&nbsp; The request should 
be as follows:</p>

<p>Pilot:&nbsp; “In the event of a missed approach, ABC requests 5000 via Victor 495, Abbotsford Airport.”</p>

<p>The contact approach&nbsp;is a means by which the pilot may deviate 
from an instrument approach and proceed to a destination airport by 
visual reference.</p>

<p>During a contact approach, an aircraft shall be flown at an altitude 
of at least 1000’ above the highest obstacle within a radius of 5 miles 
of the estimated position of the aircraft, and this requirement lasts 
until the pilot acquires the visual reference necessary to conduct a 
normal landing.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Special note:Since contact approaches 
present hazards not normally associated with instrument approaches, a 
pilot requesting a contact approach must be familiar with the physical 
layout of the airport areas.</p>

<p>A contact approach will only be approved by ATC when the following conditions exist:</p>

<ul><li>the pilot makes a request for a contact approach;</li>
	<li>the reported ground visibility is at least 1 SM; and</li>
	<li>traffic conditions permit.</li>
</ul><p>During a contact approach, ATC will provide IFR separation and 
will issue specific missed approach instructions, but obstacle clearance
 remains the responsibility of the pilot.&nbsp; For this reason, if an 
approach lacks a published missed approach procedure, a contact approach
 will not be issued.</p>

<a id="Visual Approaches"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007547">Visual Approaches</a></h3>

<p>A visual approach&nbsp;may be conducted by an aircraft operating 
under an IFR flight plan in VFR weather conditions under the control of 
ATC.</p>

<p>Visual approaches are only conducted in a radar environment, and may 
be requested by either the pilot or the controller; the following 
conditions must exist:</p>

<ul><li>the reported ceiling is at least 500’ above the minimum IFR altitude;</li>
	<li>the ground visibility is at least 3 SM;</li>
	<li>the pilot reports sighting the airport or, in the case of 
controlled airports, reports the preceding aircraft that is being 
followed.</li>
</ul><p>When a visual approach is accepted by the pilot, the pilot shall be responsible for the following:</p>

<ul><li>at controlled airports, maintaining separation from the preceding aircraft;</li>
	<li>maintaining adequate wake turbulence separation;</li>
	<li>navigation to the final approach;</li>
	<li>adherence to noise abatement procedures and Class F restrictions.</li>
</ul><p>In the event of a missed approach following a visual approach, 
the aircraft is considered as operating in accordance with VFR and ATC 
will not, therefore, issue any specific instructions.&nbsp; The aircraft
 must complete a landing as soon as possible and the pilot must contact 
ATC for further clearance if a landing cannot be accomplished.</p>

<a id="“Radar Required” Approaches"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007548">“Radar Required” Approaches</a></h3>

<p>This depiction appears on some instrument approaches at Canada’s 
major airports and essentially indicates that the initial approach 
segment for these approaches is being provided by ATC radar vectors, and
 that the instrument approach may not, therefore, be published.&nbsp;</p>

<a id="Speed Adjustments and Restrictions"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007549">Speed Adjustments and Restrictions</a></h3>

<p>The speed limits&nbsp;prescribed by CAR 602.32 applies to IFR 
aircraft—that is, a maximum speed of 250 KTS below 10000’ ASL, and a 
maximum speed of 200 KTS below 3000’ AGL when within 10 NM of a 
controlled airport.</p>

<p>Speed adjustments are specified on the basis of 10-knot intervals, 
and a pilot complying with a speed adjustment is expected to maintain a 
speed within 10 KTS of that assigned by ATC.</p>

<p>Unless “prior concurrence” in the use of a lower speed is obtained by the pilot, the following minimum speeds apply:</p>

<ul><li>
	<ul><li>all aircraft operating 20 NM or more from a destination airport:
		<ul><li>250 KTS IAS at or above 10000’ ASL; and</li>
			<li>210 KTS IAS below 10000’ ASL;</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>turbojet aircraft&nbsp;operating less than 20 NM from a destination airport—160 KTS IAS; and</li>
		<li>propeller-driven aircraft&nbsp;operating less than 20 NM from a destination airport—120 KTS IAS.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p>A speed restriction&nbsp;or adjustment is normally cancelled by 
an approach clearance, but if a specified speed is still required, the 
restriction or adjustment will be restated by the controller.</p>

<a id="Precision Radar Approaches"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007550">Precision Radar Approaches</a></h3>

<p>Precision Radar Approaches&nbsp;(PAR) are provided at selected 
military aerodromes, while civilian facilities can provide vectored 
non-precision surveillance radar approaches.&nbsp; To receive a 
surveillance radar approach there must be no alternative method of 
approach, the pilot must declare an emergency, and must request a radar 
approach.</p>

<a id="Initial Contact with Control Towers"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007551">Initial Contact with Control Towers</a></h3>

<p>When in direct contact with an Area Control Centre or a Terminal 
Control Unit, the IFR controller will advise the pilot when to make 
contact with the tower.&nbsp; Unless the approach is by way of radar 
vectors, the pilot, upon contacting the tower, should advise the tower 
of the aircraft’s ETA at the facility to be used for the intended 
approach.</p>

<p>If the above direct contact does not exist, the pilot will establish 
radio communication with the tower when approximately 25 NM from the 
airport.&nbsp; The pilot must provide an ETA, obtain an approach 
clearance if one has not already been received, and advise the tower of 
approach intentions.&nbsp; Obviously, the pilot must continue to monitor
 the tower frequency.</p>

<p>Where an ETA is passed by the pilot, it shall include the point, fix or facility to which the ETA applies.</p>

<a id="Position Reporting at Controlled and Uncontrolled Airports"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007552">Position Reporting at Controlled and Uncontrolled Airports</a></h3>

<p>When conducting an instrument approach at a controlled airport, the 
pilot shall only make position reports that are requested by ATC.</p>

<p>When operating under IFR and intending to conduct an instrument 
approach at an uncontrolled airport, the pilot must broadcast reports as
 follows:</p>

<ul><li>
	<ul><li>report 5 minutes prior to the estimated time of commencing the 
approach procedure, including intentions and estimated time of landing;</li>
		<li>report upon passing the fix with the intention of conducting a 
procedure turn, or, where a procedure turn is not intended, upon 
intercepting the final approach track;</li>
		<li>report upon passing the final approach fix during the final 
approach or 3 minutes before the estimated time of landing where no 
final approach fix exists;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">1</a></li>
		<li>report intentions upon commencing a circling procedure;</li>
		<li>report turning onto the final approach leg;</li>
		<li>report a missed approach as soon as practical after commencement.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p>At uncontrolled airports, IFR pilot are expected to conform with the prevailing VFR circuit pattern.</p>

<a id="IFR Procedures at Airports in Uncontrolled Airspace"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007553">IFR Procedures at Airports in Uncontrolled Airspace</a></h3>

<p>Whenever practical, 126.7 MHz should be monitored, and intentions 
broadcast on this frequency prior to an altitude change or prior to 
commencing an approach.&nbsp; Where a MF frequency exists, these 
intentions should be broadcast prior to switching to the MF frequency.</p>

<p>Where an advisory ground station providing weather and runway 
condition reports does not exist, straight in approaches should not be 
made and pilots must verify if the runway is unobstructed prior to 
landing; instead, the runway should be inspected using the published 
circling MDA.&nbsp; If VFR conditions prevail, the approach and landing 
should be made by way of normal VFR circuit procedures.&nbsp; Aircraft 
operating IFR at uncontrolled airports in uncontrolled airspace do not 
have priority over VFR aircraft.</p>

<a id="Outbound Reports"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007554">Outbound Reports</a></h3>

<p>Outbound reports are made when an aircraft conducting a full 
procedure turn passes the Final Approach Fix away from the airport for 
the purpose of starting the procedure descent (procedure turn):</p>

<p>“Abbotsford Tower, ABC is beacon outbound.”</p>

<p>This report should be made only after the aircraft is over or abeam the approach facility and proceeding away from the airport.</p>

<a id="Coffin Corner"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007555">Coffin Corner</a></h3>

<p>Special consideration must always be given to notations that appear 
on approach plates.&nbsp; In the case of the CAP format, these appear in
 the upper left-hand corner—respectfully referred to as coffin corner.</p>

<p><img alt="Castlegar IFR approach.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Castlegar%2520planview%2520of%2520the%2520C%2520approach.gif"></p>

<p>Coffin corner for one of the Castlegar approaches appears above—an 
airport notorious for special considerations.&nbsp; As with all 
instrument approach plates, the notations that appear here have to be 
included in the approach plate briefing.&nbsp; Many of the 
Castlegar&nbsp;notions are unique to this airport, but a good portion of
 the notations are standard and appear on many approach plates.</p>

<a id="Pressure Considerations and Temperature Corrections"></a><h3><a name="_Toc179007556">Pressure Considerations and Temperature Corrections</a></h3>

<p>An altimeter setting is considered current up to 90 minutes from the 
time of observation, but care must be exercised when using an altimeter 
setting that is older than 60 minutes, or when the pressure is reported 
as falling rapidly.</p>

<p>Where remote altimeter setting are authorised for an approach 
procedure, the authorisation is also usually accompanied by a correction
 value.&nbsp; When conducting the approach at Langley Airport when the 
Tower is closed, for example, the Abbotsford altimeter setting is used 
and 50’ must be added to all altitudes.&nbsp; This requirement appears 
in the coffin corner of this approach plate.&nbsp; A similar requirement
 is specified for the NDB and GPS approaches at Nanaimo Airport.</p>

<p>If a remote altimeter setting is permanently prescribed in the 
published procedure—the Qualicum Beach GPS 29 is an example of this—the 
correction figure is incorporated into the published altitudes.</p>

<p>With respect to temperature corrections, a Cold Temperature 
Corrections Table&nbsp;(below) is published both in the AIP (RAC Fig. 
9.1), and in the General Pages of the Canada Air Pilot; this table 
prescribes values to be added to the published altitude values for a 
procedures.&nbsp; These values must be added whenever the temperature is
 below 0° C.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Arrivals,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Altitude%2520correction%2520chart.gif"></p>

<p>Both the remote pressure and the cold temperature values to be added 
must be applied to all published procedure altitudes, including minimum 
sector altitudes and DME arcs in order to ensure adequate obstacle 
clearance.</p>

<p>Importantly, the pressure and temperature corrections do not apply to ATC-assigned altitudes or vectored altitudes.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">2</a></p>

<p>Whenever altitude corrections are applied to published final approach
 fix crossing altitudes, procedure turn or missed approach altitudes, 
pilots should advise ATC how much correction is to be applied.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">3</a></p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">1</a> An example of this is where the approach facility such as an NDB or VOR is located at the airport.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">2</a> A pilot may accept or refuse an IFR-assigned altitude base on assessment of the effects of temperature on obstacle clearance.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">3</a> It would be quite 
awkward and impractical for the pilot to review each altitude correction
 individually—the values applied vary with the height of each published 
figure above the elevation of the altimeter source.&nbsp; Instead, the 
pilot could simply advise ATC—“corrections will be applied -10°C.”</p>
