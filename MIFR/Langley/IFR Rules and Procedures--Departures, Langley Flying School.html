<h1>IFR DEPARTURES—RULES AND PROCEDURES</h1>

<h2>Departure Obstacle and Terrain Clearance</h2>

<p>IFR departure procedures can be ground into two broad 
categories—procedures that are specified and procedures that are 
unspecified.</p>

<h3>Unspecified Departure Procedures</h3>

<p>Included in the category of airports with <em>unspecified IFR departure procedures</em> are departures from airports not listed in the <em>Canada Air Pilot</em> or the <em>Jeppesen Airways Manual</em>.&nbsp; It is quite legal to make an IFR departure from these so-called “VFR” airports,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">1</a>
 but there are no specified IFR departure procedures to follow.&nbsp; 
Conversely, there are also airports that appear in CAP/JEP with 
published instrument approach procedures, but which have <em>not been assessed</em>
 with respect to IFR departures—i.e., obstacle and terrain clearance 
required.&nbsp; The IFR departure procedure&nbsp;for these airports is 
published as “not assessed.”&nbsp; “Not assessed” airports are becoming 
more and more rare.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">2</a></p>

<p>Where IFR departure procedures are unspecified, it is the pilot’s sole responsibility to ensure terrain and obstacle clearance.</p>

<h3>Specified Departure Procedures</h3>

<p>Airports with <em>specified IFR departure procedures</em>,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">3</a>
 in contrast, are grouped on the basis of whether or not terrain and 
obstacles in the vicinity of the airport requires special 
restriction.&nbsp; Essentially, the airport is assessed as to whether or
 not terrain and obstacles meet what is described as the <em>minimum climb gradient</em>&nbsp;for IFR aircraft.&nbsp; The assumptions used to assess the minimum climb gradient are as follows:</p>

<p><em>After take-off, an IFR aircraft will</em></p>

<ul><li><em>cross the departure end of a runway by at least 35’;</em></li>
	<li><em>climb straight ahead to 400’ AAE prior to commending any turns; and</em></li>
	<li><em>maintain a climb gradient of at least 200’ per NM throughout the climb to a minimum IFR altitude for en route operations</em><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><em>4</em></a><em>.</em></li>
</ul><p><img alt="Requirements for Standard IFR Departure, Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Departures,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Departure%2520requirements.gif"></p>

<p>In conjunction with the minimum climb gradient of 200’/NM, obstacles 
and terrain around the airport are assessed as to whether or not they 
penetrate specified <em>slope</em> or <em>plane</em> that is projected 
in all quadrants around the airport.&nbsp; The slope, which appears as 
an inverted cone, is based 35’ above the departure end of the runway, 
and subsequently extends upward at a rate of 152’ per 1 NM.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">5</a>&nbsp; If this slope is <em>not</em>
 penetrated by vicinity obstacles or terrain, Transport Canada will not 
publish special departure procedures in CAP, and the departure procedure
 is simply identified on the basis of the standard IFR visibility 
requirement—<strong><em>½ SM</em></strong>.&nbsp; By comparison, if this
 slope is penetrated, Transport Canada will publish specified IFR 
departure procedure&nbsp;designed to avoid the obstacles or 
terrain.&nbsp; The specified procedures are identified in CAP by the 
appearance of an asterisk—<strong>*</strong>—which refers the pilot to the text description of the procedure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped"><tbody><tr><th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">
			<p><strong>½</strong></p>
			</th>
			<td>
			<p>The departure procedure does not present any abnormal or unusual 
hazards.&nbsp; If the departing aircraft conforms to standard 
performance criteria, a departure can be conducted with ½ SM.&nbsp; The 
aircraft may safely turn in any direction after climbing straight-out to
 400’ AAE, provided the minimum climb gradient of 200’/NM is maintained 
to vicinity MEAs.</p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">
			<p>*</p>
			</th>
			<td>
			<p>The departure procedure does present potentially abnormal or 
unusual hazards.&nbsp; To ensure safe terrain and obstacle clearance for
 an IFR departure, specified procedures—indicated by the asterisk—must 
be adhered to.</p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><th style="white-space: nowrap; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">
			<p><strong>NOT ASSESSED</strong></p>
			</th>
			<td>
			<p>As implied, the departure requirements for the airport have not 
been assessed.&nbsp; The pilot is solely responsible to ensure safe 
separation from terrain and obstacles</p>
			</td>
		</tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Information pertaining to an airport’s IFR Departure Procedure is found on the <em>Aerodrome Chart</em> page, and in particular the box that appears in the lower left-hand corner marked <em>Takeoff Minima</em>.</p>

<p>Appearing in the Takeoff Minima box, the published <em>IFR Departure Procedure</em> will therefore take one of three forms, summarised above.</p>

<h3>Unrestricted IFR Departures (½)</h3>

<p><img alt="Fort St. John IFR Airport Plate (Classroom purposes), Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Departures,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Fort%2520St.gif"></p>

<p>The “½” depiction means “<em>takeoff, climb on course</em>” for the 
specified runway or runways.&nbsp; This is the case, for example, with 
respect to an IFR departure from any of the runways that appear at Fort 
St. John Airport—see the <em>Takeoff Minima</em> box in the lower 
left-hand corner.&nbsp; It is implied, therefore, that the terrain 
surrounding Fort St. John Airport presents less terrain and obstacle 
hazards then, for example, an IFR departure from an airport located in a
 mountainous area.&nbsp; Specifically, based on the ½ depiction that is 
published for Fort St. John, we can assume that no obstacles penetrate 
the reference slope or plane extending upward in all quadrants at a rate
 of 152’ per nautical mile.&nbsp; The bottom of this “inverted cone” is 
based 35’ above the departure end of the runway.&nbsp; Since all of the 
runways are rated as simply “½” we know that this clearance requirement 
is met for all for runway departure ends that appear at this airport.</p>

<h3>Restricted IFR Departures (*)</h3>

<p>The appearance of the asterisk for a specified runway implies that 
reference must be made to required published procedures to ensure 
obstacle and terrain clearance, which may include specified climb 
gradients, routings, and/or visual climb requirements.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">6</a>&nbsp; An example of this is the specified departure procedures for Prince George.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">7</a></p>

<p><img alt="Prince George IFR Airport Plate (classroom purposes only), Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Departures,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Prince%2520George%2520Airport%2520Plate.gif"></p>

<p>Examining the departure procedures you will note two types.&nbsp; 
First there are those runways where the minimum ½ SM visibility is 
specified, but for which prescribed routing must be followed—this is the
 case, for example, with respect to the departures from Rwys 15, 33, and
 06.&nbsp; In contrast, the departure from Rwy 24 requires not ½ SM, but
 <em>specified</em> visibility—SPEC VIS— to a <em>specified</em> 
altitude—in this case, 2700’ ASL.&nbsp; In the case of the ½ SM 
departures, only visibility governs, and cloud ceiling has nothing to do
 with it.&nbsp; In the case of the SPEC VIS departure from Rwy 24, 
however, both visibility and cloud ceiling govern.</p>

<p>In the case of ceiling that is required, this of course will vary 
with each specified departure.&nbsp; In the case of visibility, however,
 we must return to the prescribed aircraft category based on manoeuvring
 speed:</p>

<p><img alt="Maneuvering Categories for Aircraft, Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Departures,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Aircraft%2520category.gif"></p>

<p>Remember that the manoeuvring speed specified here does not relate to
 Va, but instead relates in this case to the planned speed the pilot 
will manoeuvre the aircraft during the departure phase of flight.&nbsp; 
Based on the speed category, the <em>Specified Takeoff Minimum Visibility</em>&nbsp;(SPEC VIS) is prescribed as follows:</p>

<p><img alt="Categories for Specified Visibilities, Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Departures,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Spec%2520Vis%2520Cats.gif"></p>

<p>Accordingly, an IFR departure off Rwy 24 requires in the case of 
Category B aircraft—aircraft with a departure manoeuvring speed of 
between 91 and 120 KTS—a reported surface visibility of 1½ SM.&nbsp; In 
contrast, Rwys 15 and 33 are less restrictive to IFR departures, 
requiring only ½ SM.&nbsp; Note that IFR departures are not mentioned 
with respect to Rwys 19, 01, and 06.&nbsp; Departures off these runways 
will not be authorised for IFR aircraft; instead, the aircraft would 
have to depart VFR with the intention of activating an IFR clearance 
once in the air.</p>

<p>The Prince George departure procedures are somewhat unusual as 
normally the appearance of a SPEC VIS component is provided as an 
alternative to ½ SM departures with higher than normal climb 
gradient.&nbsp; Thus, aircraft that cannot meet the required higher 
climb gradient or gradients can choose the SPEC VIS alternative.&nbsp; 
It is important to remember, however, the minimum IFR climb gradient of 
200’/NM still apply to SPEC VIS departures after cloud has been entered 
(the prescribed altitude to which a visual climb is specified).</p>

<p>More commonly, the SPEC VIS departures are provided as an alternative
 to the ½ SM departures that have higher than normal climb 
gradients.&nbsp; This is the case, for example, with the departures that
 are published for Cranbrook Airport, as depicted below.</p>

<p><img alt="Cranbrook IFR Airport Plate (Classroom only), Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Departures,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Cranbrook%2520airport%2520plate.gif"></p>

<p>All of the departure options from Cranbrook have specified routings, 
owing to the imposing height of surrounding terrain.&nbsp; Pilots are 
nevertheless given two options.</p>

<p>The first option to take the ½ SM departures.&nbsp; Careful 
consideration must be given to the climb gradient capabilities of the 
aircraft and whether those published can be sustained to the en route 
MEAs.&nbsp; A Category A or B aircraft requires only 270’ per NM climb 
to depart off Runway 16, but to depart off Runway 34 will require a more
 demanding 420’/NM.&nbsp; The advantage of these departures is that 
consideration must only be given to visibility, which is the governing 
factor—only ½ SM ground visibility on departure is required, 
irrespective of the ceiling.&nbsp; The disadvantage of these departures 
pertains to whether or not the required climb gradients can be 
sustained—in a light twin, for example, it is quite likely that the 
failure of an engine will quickly render the aircraft unable to comply.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">8</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, careful consideration must be given to the ability of 
the aircraft to meet or exceed the increased climb gradients.&nbsp; To 
do this, the climb gradient chart&nbsp;that appears in CAP GEN must be 
consulted.&nbsp; This graph, depicted below,<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">9</a>
 enables the conversion of a “feet per nautical mile” value to a “feet 
per minute” value, based on the anticipated groundspeed during the 
departure phase.&nbsp; Be sure not to mix up the scales posted on either
 side of the graph.&nbsp; Note also that a multi-engine pilot should 
plug in the published single-engine climb performance valued (assuming 
one of the engines has failed).&nbsp; The example shown demonstrates the
 application of the Cranbrook climb gradient required for the ½ SM 
departure off Runway 16; the climb groundspeed is assumed to be 120 
KTS.&nbsp; For some airports, the climb rates, based on the specified 
climb gradients,&nbsp; are set out in table form on the CAP 
plates;&nbsp; these are always provided in JEP plates.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="IFR Climb gradient Conversion Chart, Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Departures,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/conversion%2520table%2520for%2520climb%2520gradients.gif"></p>

<p>In the case of the SPEC VIS procedure for Cranbrook Airport, climb 
gradient is of course not specified in the text description.&nbsp; Don’t
 let this create any confusion, however, as the assumed minimum climb 
gradient of 200’/NM still applies.&nbsp; This requirement, however, only
 kicks in after the aircraft has climbed visually over the airport to 
the specified altitude—in the case of Cranbrook, 4400’ ASL.&nbsp; Thus, 
ceiling limitations govern SPEC VIS departures.&nbsp; When evaluating 
the latest METAR sequence, be sure you properly convert the SPEC VIS 
altitude—published in height above sea level—to the METAR ceiling 
values—height above ground.&nbsp; To conduct the SPEC VIS departure from
 Cranbrook, then, the minimum ceiling requirement that must appear in 
the METAR is 4400’ minus the elevation of the airport—3082’ (as 
published in the <em>Canada Flight Supplement</em>).&nbsp; So the ceiling must be 1400’ or higher.</p>

<p>In the absence of a published visibility, the pilot may depart using a
 takeoff visibility that will allow obstacle and terrain clearance, but 
in no case should the takeoff visibility be less than ½ SM.</p>

<p>Additionally, where aircraft or other limitations preclude a pilot 
from conforming to published procedures, the pilot is again responsible 
for determining alternative safe departure procedures.</p>

<h3>Initial Contact</h3>

<p>On initial contact with ATC a departing IFR pilot should state the destination and planned initial cruising altitude.</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>Pilot:</em></strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong><em>“Langley Ground, this is Seneca ABC at Hangar 17 with information Alpha.&nbsp; IFR Victoria, 4000.”</em></strong></p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>ATC:</em></strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong><em>“ABC, Roger . . .”</em></strong></p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>Pilot:</em></strong></p>

			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong><em>“ABC, </em></strong><strong><em>Victoria</em></strong><strong><em> Clearance, Roger . . .”</em></strong></p>
			</td>
		</tr></tbody></table><h3>IFR Clearances</h3>

<p>Where a <em>Clearance Delivery</em> frequency is published, the pilot shall obtain the IFR clearance on this frequency prior to contacting ground control.</p>

<p>Where Clearance Delivery does not exist, the ground controller will 
provide the IFR clearance after a taxi authorisation is issued.</p>

<p>For turbojet aircraft with high fuel consumption rates, IFR clearances may be obtained prior to engine start with the phrase <strong><em>“Ready to start now . .”</em></strong> or <strong><em>“Ready to start at (time) . .”</em></strong> and such requests should be made within 5 minutes of actual engine start.</p>

<h3>Standard Instrument Departures &nbsp;(SIDs)</h3>

<p>A SID is a planned IFR air traffic control departure procedure 
published in CAP/JEP.&nbsp; It contains both a descriptive text as well 
as a graphic depiction.&nbsp; They are designed to provide an instrument
 flight transition from the terminal environment to the en route 
structure.</p>

<p>There are two types of SIDs, the first being a <em>Pilot Navigation SID</em>&nbsp;whereby
 the pilot is required to use the chart as reference for navigation, and
 the second is the Vectored SID&nbsp;in which ATC provides radar 
navigation guidance to routes or fixes depicted on IFR charts.</p>

<p><img alt="Kelowna Three Departure (Classroom only), Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Departures,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Kelowna%2520Three%2520Dep.jpg"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Nanaimo eight Departure" src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--Departures,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Nanaimo%2520Eight%2520Departure.jpg"></p>

<p>Pilots are not required to accept a SID clearance and the pilot 
should request a detailed clearance should doubt exist concerning the 
SID requirements.</p>

<p>There are two segments associated with a SID, the first or initial 
segment is from the departure end of the runway and lasts until the 
aircraft first turns from the initial departure heading, and the second 
segment begins lasts from the first turning point to the SID termination
 point.</p>

<p>If an IFR pilot is instructed to fly <em>“runway heading”</em> or if a
 SID does not specify a heading for the first segment, the pilot is 
expected to maintain a heading that corresponds with the extended centre
 line of the departure runway.&nbsp; Drift corrections are not applied.</p>

<p>Where a SID contains a specific published heading, the heading must of course be maintained until vectoring begins.</p>

<p>When a SID clearance is issued, the clearance includes the name of 
the SID, the SID termination fix (if appropriate), the transition (if 
necessary) and, also if necessary, the time or location at which the 
pilot may expect to climb to an suitable altitude (this may be conveyed 
by way of “expect further clearance”).</p>

<p>ATC may amend elements of a SID—for example the initial heading or altitude—but this amendment does not cancel the SID.</p>

<p>If ATC assigns an altitude that is not operationally suitable, and if
 the pilot has not been informed when a clearance to another altitude 
may be expected, it is the responsibility of the pilot to advise ATC of 
the unsatisfactory altitude assignment.&nbsp; The pilot, in evaluating 
an altitude assignment, must ensure the altitude will permit flight to 
the destination airport should a communications failure occur.</p>

<p>SIDs may specify communication failure procedures, and such procedures supersede standard communication failure procedures.</p>

<p>SIDs will conform to any noise abatement procedures governing 
departures, and radar vectors will only begin once noise abatement 
procedures are completed.</p>

<p>It is important to note that ATC expressions such as “<em>on departure, right turn climb on course</em>” or “<em>on departure, left turn on course</em>”
 are not to be regarded as specific departure instructions, and it 
remains the pilot’s responsibility to ensure terrain and obstacle 
clearance is achieved by first conforming with the IFR departure 
procedure.</p>

<p>While civilian SIDs incorporate obstacle and terrain clearance, this 
is not the case with textual form of SIDs published for military 
aerodromes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Release from Tower Frequency</h3>

<p>If an IFR departure is made within a terminal control area, the pilot
 will be cleared by the tower to contact a specific control unit on a 
specified frequency once the aircraft is clear of conflicting traffic.</p>

<p>Where the pilot is advised prior to takeoff to change to a specific 
departure frequency, this change should be done as soon as practicable 
after takeoff.</p>

<p>If the departure airport is not located in a terminal control area, 
the pilot, when requesting a release from frequency, should advise the 
tower of the frequency or agency the pilot intends to change to.</p>

<p>The initial call to a departure controller should contain at least the following:</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>Pilot:</em></strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong><em>“Victoria Terminal.&nbsp; ABC climbing off Runway 19 </em></strong><strong><em>Langley</em></strong><strong><em>.&nbsp; Through 1600’ for 2000’.”</em></strong></p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>ATC:</em></strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong><em>“ABC, roger.&nbsp; Squawk Ident.”</em></strong></p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>ATC:</em></strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong><em>“ABC is radar identified through 1800’.&nbsp; Maintain 4000’.”</em></strong></p>
			</td>
		</tr></tbody></table><ul><li>the aircraft call sign;</li>
	<li>the runway of departure;</li>
	<li>the present altitude vacating (to the nearest 100’ increment)<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">10</a>; and</li>
	<li>the assigned altitude (including the altitude contained in a SID if applicable).</li>
</ul><h3>Noise Abatement</h3>

<p>Nothing in a noise abatement procedure&nbsp;shall prevent a pilot 
from exercising authority for safe operations.&nbsp; The one exception 
is the climb gradient which, if published, must be maintained or an 
alternative procedure adopted.</p>

<p>Noise abatement will not be a factor in determining the departure 
runway when the runway is not dry and clear, the crosswind exceeds 25 
KT, or the tailwind does not exceed 5 KT.</p>

<p>Airports with a departure procedure published in CAP/JEP are said to have an <em>IFR Departure Procedure</em>.</p>

<h3>IFR Departures from Uncontrolled Airports</h3>

<p>If an IFR departure is planned from an uncontrolled airport, the pilot shall</p>

<ul><li>obtain an ATC clearance if in controlled airspace;</li>
	<li>report intentions and departure procedures prior to moving on to 
the runway or before aligning the aircraft on the takeoff path; and</li>
	<li>determine by radio and visual observation that no other aircraft or vehicle will present a conflict during takeoff.</li>
</ul><p>Additionally, the pilot shall maintain a listening watch during 
takeoff from an uncontrolled airport and after takeoff from an 
uncontrolled airport where an MF has been designated (and maintain the 
listening watch until the aircraft has departed from the specified 
distance and/or altitude associated with an MF).</p>

<p>As soon as possible after leaving the specified distance and/or 
altitude associated with the MF, the pilot shall communicate with the 
appropriate ATC unit or a ground unit on the en route frequency.</p>

<p><strong><em>Special Note:</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;
 If an aircraft does not commence a departure within 60 minutes of the 
proposed departure time specified in an IFR flight plan, Search and 
Rescue will be activated.</strong></p>

Class F airspace, or it can be used to integrate departing IFR aircraft 
with overlying ATC airspace and routing structures.&nbsp; In the case of
 Langley Airport, for example, the specified routing to the Whatcom 
VORTAC after departure reduces conflict with the final approach courses 
for Vancouver Airport, and keeps Langley departures out of surrounding 
Class F airspace.</p>

failure of an engine in a light twin out of Cranbrook, the pilot of an

aircraft.&nbsp; With this scenario, you can see the important of only 
conducting a departure if the weather at the departure airport is above 
or at the approach minima.&nbsp; With a departure in weather below 
approach minima, an aircraft cannot safely return in the event of an 
emergency.&nbsp; For this reason, the regulations governing commercial 
operations prohibit the departure of an aircraft that cannot sustain 
adequate single-engine climb performance from departing IFR when weather
 is below approach minima, irrespective of departure minima.</p>

 The readout is considered invalid if it exceeds the reported value by
