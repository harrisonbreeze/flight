 You can think of them as families.&nbsp; The Pitot-Statics are an 
extraordinary lazy bunch.&nbsp; They are slow moving, and always lagging
 behind the action—you can’t always trust what they say.&nbsp; In 
contrast, the Gyro are a really honest bunch; they always keep up with 
the latest trends and are always on time—the Gyros are always in the 
centre of the action when it happens.</p>

<a id="Pitot-static Instruments"></a><h2>Pitot-static Instruments</h2>

<p>The pitot-static system records static and dynamic air pressure, 
providing the pilot with information related to airspeed and altitude.</p>

<p>These pressures typically enter the system by way of ports located on the fuselage (<em>static pressure sources</em>) and the wing (<em>dynamic pressure source</em>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Flight%20Instruments,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Flight%252520Instruments%252520Pitot-static%252520Instruments%252520.gif"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of the flight instruments which make use of the pitot-static 
system—the airspeed indicator (ASI), the vertical speed indicator (VSI),
 and the altimeter (ALT), only the ASI is connected to both pressure 
sources.</p>

<a id="Airspeed Indicator"></a><h3>Airspeed Indicator</h3>

<p>Connected to both the static and pitot (dynamic) ports, the ASI records the <em>pressure difference</em> (speed); each is measured by an expansion box referred to as an <em>aneroid capsule</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Flight%20Instruments,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Flight%252520Instruments%252520Airspeed%252520Indicator%252520Langle.gif"></p>

<p>As altitudes above 10000’ and at calibrated airspeed in excess of 200 KTS, an error in airspeed indications—referred to as <em>compressibility error</em>—will occur as a result of air being <em>compressed at the pitot tube inlet</em>.&nbsp; Compressibility error generally produces ASI readings that are <em>too high</em>.</p>

<p>There are three primary types of airspeed:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle">
			<p>Indicated Airspeed (IAS)</p>
			</td>
			<td style="vertical-align:middle">
			<p>Uncorrected speed is read from the ASI.&nbsp; As altitude is increased, the ASI under-reads approximately 2% per 1000’.</p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle">
			<p>Calibrated Airspeed&nbsp;(CAS)</p>
			</td>
			<td style="vertical-align:middle">
			<p>IAS corrected for instrument and installation error; such errors 
are especially prominent in flights involving high angles of 
attack.&nbsp; Correction charts are usually found in the <em>Pilot Operating Handbook</em>.</p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle">
			<p>True Airspeed&nbsp;(TAS)</p>
			</td>
			<td style="vertical-align:middle">
			<p>CAS (usually IAS) corrected for air density (altitude and 
temperature); used primarily for flight planning groundspeed.&nbsp; 
Pressure altitude (discussed below), temperature, and IAS are entered on
 the appropriate flight calculator scales.&nbsp; (Note: the scales on 
E6B computer indicate CAS, rather than IAS, but should be interpreted as
 IAS for most practical purposes.)</p>
			</td>
		</tr></tbody></table><p>Here are the markings on an ASI:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Red line:&nbsp;&nbsp; never-exceed speed&nbsp;(Vne).</p>

<p>Yellow arc:&nbsp;caution speed range, never to be intentionally 
entered, with the upper limit being Vne, and the lower limit being the 
maximum structural cruising speed (Vno).</p>

<p>Green arc:&nbsp;normal operating speed range, with the lower limit 
being the power-off stall speed, including flaps and gear up (Vsl), and 
the upper limit being Vno.</p>

<p>White arc:&nbsp;flaps extension speed range—where flaps can be used, 
with the lower limit being the power-off stall speed with flaps and gear
 down (Vso), and the upper limit being the “maximum flaps extension 
speed” (Vfe).</p>

<p><strong>Note that manoeuvring speed&nbsp;(Va) is not indicated on the instrument.</strong></p>

<p>Also, for multi-engine aircraft, two additional markings appear on 
the ASI.&nbsp; A red radial line or arc appears above the stall speeds 
indicating the minimum speed, below which control of the aircraft could 
be lost when operating with one engine out—this speed is the minimum 
control speed&nbsp;(<strong>Vmc</strong>).&nbsp; The second marking is a blue radial line or arc, which indicates the best rate single-engine climb speed (<strong>Vyse)</strong>.</p>

<a id="Altimeter"></a><h3>Altimeter</h3>

<p>The ALT is an airtight instrument case connected <em>only to the static port</em>;
 when the altitude of an aircraft increases, the pressure within the 
case decreases and a sealed aneroid capsule within the case expands, 
this expansion registered on the instrument face.</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Flight%20Instruments,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Flight%252520Instruments%252520Altimeter%252520Langley%252520Flying%25.gif"></p>

<p>It is calibrated on the basis of <em>ICAO Standard Atmosphere</em> 
assumptions of standard sea level pressure (29.92” Hg), a pressure lapse
 rate of 1 inch per 1000’, and a standard temperature lapse rate (1.98°C
 per 1000’).</p>

<p>In the case that a <em>static port</em> <em>becomes blocked during flight</em>, most aircraft have an <em>alternate static source</em>&nbsp;switch in the cockpit that can be selected by the pilot.</p>

<p>If an altimeter indicates in excess of a 50’ error at sea level when set to the ALT pressure setting, the instrument is <em>unserviceable</em>; this tolerance increases with altitude (from ± 50’ at sea level to ± 230’ at 40000’).</p>

<p>There are two errors associated with the ALT: <em>temperature errors</em> and <em>pressure errors</em>.&nbsp;
 When flying from a high-pressure area to a low-pressure area, the ALT 
will read higher than actual altitude; similarly, when flying from warm 
air to cold air, the ALT will again read higher than actual 
altitude.&nbsp; <em>“From high to low, watch out below.”&nbsp; “From warm to cold, watch out . .”</em></p>

<p>In addition to temperature and pressure errors, human error is not an
 uncommon cause of accidents.&nbsp; The effect of pressure is the same 
here, but the phraseology is slightly different: <em>Too high subscale setting means a too high altimeter reading</em>—that is, the aircraft would be at a lower level than is indicated, while <em>too low subscale setting means a too low altimeter reading</em>—that is, the aircraft would be at a higher level than is indicated.</p>

<p>The <em>only time</em> an altimeter will read an accurate or “true” 
altitude of an aircraft during flight is when ICAO Standard Atmosphere 
exists—an unlikely event.</p>

<p>When an altimeter set to the altimeter setting of an airport, the <em>only time a pilot can be certain the altimeter is an accurate indication of “true” altitude</em> is when the aircraft is on the ground at that airport.</p>

<p>Lag is associated with this instrument during climbs and descents (as
 a result of hysteresis, the period of time required for the aneroid to 
catch up to the changing pressure in the instrument case), and for this 
reason a good rule of thumb is to “lead” the altimeter indications—i.e.,
 begin the levelling procedure with the necessary pitch inputs—using 10%
 of the vertical speed indications.&nbsp; For example, descending at 
100’/min., the levelling inputs should be started 100’ above the target 
altitude.</p>

<p>There are five types of altitudes:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped"><tbody><tr><td>
			<p>Indicated Altitude</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The reading on the altimeter when it is set to the current barometric pressure.</p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td>
			<p>Pressure Altitude</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The reading on the altimeter when it is set to standard pressure 
(29.92” Hg); this is used primarily in the calculation of aircraft 
performance and for calculating “true altitude.”</p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td>
			<p>Density Altitude</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Pressure altitude corrected for non-standard temperature, use 
primarily to predict aircraft performance during takeoffs.&nbsp; To 
calculate, the altimeter is set to 29.92” Hg (pressure altitude) and 
this figure entered on a flight computer on the appropriate scale.&nbsp;
 If an altimeter is not available, use the difference between standard 
pressure and the current altimeter setting; if the current pressure is 
lower than standard pressure, altitude is increased at a rate of 1000’ 
per 1-inch difference; if it is higher, the altitude is decreased.&nbsp;
 Aircraft performance graphs in the <em>Pilot Operating Handbook</em> usually provide a built-in calculation.</p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td>
			<p>True Altitude</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>“Exact height above mean sea level.”&nbsp; This is used when a 
pilot wants the most accurate calculation of altitude—for example, when 
flying over mountainous regions.&nbsp; The current altimeter setting and
 elevation of the reporting station is noted.&nbsp; The pressure 
altitude of the aircraft is set into the E6B opposite ambient 
temperature (at altitude); the height of airspace lying between the 
aircraft (specifically, the indicated altitude) and the reporting 
station is then marked on the inner scale and the true altitude of that 
airspace is read on the outer scale.&nbsp; Finally, the true altitude 
figure is then added back to the reporting station’s elevation to give 
the aircraft’s true altitude.</p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td>
			<p>Absolute Altitude&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>“Height of the aircraft above the surface of earth.”&nbsp; Not commonly used, unless the aircraft has radar.</p>
			</td>
		</tr></tbody></table><a id="Vertical Speed Indicator"></a><h3>Vertical Speed Indicator</h3>

<p>The final pitot-static instrument is the VSI, which indicates the 
vertical speed of the aircraft—i.e., the vertical component of the 
aircraft’s flight path—in hundreds of feet per minute.&nbsp; The sealed 
instrument case is connected to <em>static pressure by way of a calibrated leak—i.e., a “slow bleeding” leak referred to as a restricted diffuser</em><em>.</em>&nbsp;
 Inside the case is a diaphragm that flexes in response to the pressure 
changes associated with a change in altitude; when the aircraft levels 
off, the diffuser equalises the pressures on either side of the 
diaphragm causing the instrument readings to go to zero.&nbsp; The 
diffuser is designed to equalise pressures in approximately six to nine 
seconds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Flight%20Instruments,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Flight%252520Instruments%252520Vertical%252520Speed%252520Indicator%25.gif"></p>

<p>The VSI&nbsp;is most accurate recording <em>small changes in altitude</em>, but becomes <em>less accurate the greater the rate of descent or climb.</em></p>

<p>It is connected to the static port, so an alternate means of 
restoring static pressure for the altimeter if the static port becomes 
blocked is to deliberately break the glass on the VSI.</p>

<a id="Malfunction of the Pitot-Static System"></a><h2>Malfunction of the Pitot-Static System</h2>

<p>Instrument pilots are literally <em>hanging</em> from the 
pilot-static instruments.&nbsp; The penultimate line of defence is the 
gyro-system instruments, but if they fail or malfunction, survival 
depends on the expansion and contraction of the aneroid capsules which, 
in turn, give us very basic information concerning the aircraft’s 
attitude.&nbsp; In cloud, it is the pitot-static system which is, 
essentially, our lifejackets.&nbsp; So, you want to be smart with 
respect to possible malfunctions.</p>

<p>In the case of a <em>sudden blockage</em> of the <em>static port</em> , <em>the ASI will under-read in a climb, and over-read in a descent</em>.&nbsp;
 This is because there are no correction for the pitot pressure with 
respect to vertical changes in air density.&nbsp; Conversely, in the 
event of a <em>sudden blockage</em> of the <em>pitot tube</em> &nbsp;(port), the ASI will <em>over-read during a climb, and under-read during a descent</em>.&nbsp; In this case, trapped pitot pressure is being overpowered by vertical changes in air density.</p>

<p>It should be kept in mind, however, that blockages can occur<em> slowly</em>—as
 would be the case, for example, in the case of gradual ice 
accumulations.&nbsp; As you would expect, a gradual reduction in pitot 
pressure <em>will cause a slow reduction in indicated airspeed.</em></p>

<p>There are three primary gyro instruments: heading indicator (HI), 
attitude indicator (AI), and the turn and slip indicator/turn 
co-ordinator.</p>

<p>All gyros consist of a spinning rotor held in a <em>universal mounting</em>&nbsp;or <em>gimbals</em>, which enables the rotor to remain in a constant position when the instrument casing is moved.</p>

<p>The spinning of the gyro is powered by two means.&nbsp; The HI and AI are driven by <em>vacuum pressure</em>&nbsp;(engine-driven
 or venturi).&nbsp; Engine-driven vacuum pressure is included among the 
pre-takeoff check whereby the air pressure driving the gyro can be read 
in inches of mercury (“Hg.).&nbsp; By comparison, the gyros on the turn 
co-ordinator (or the older turn and slip indicator) is driven by an <em>electric motor</em>; if the electric motor provides insufficient RPMs to the gyro, a “flag” appears on the instrument display.</p>

<p>Most gyros require approximately 5 minutes to come to rotation speed.</p>

<p>In conditions of poor to zero visibility, it is impossible to fly an 
aircraft without flight instruments that depict pitch, roll, and yaw; in
 cloud, a <em>pilot’s life rests with the correct function of these instruments.</em>&nbsp;
 The electric/vacuum drive systems provide backup whereby all of the 
instruments cannot fail simultaneously.&nbsp; For added security, the 
gyro instruments are always checked during taxiing before takeoff.</p>

<p>Two principles affect all gyros: <em>gyroscopic inertia</em>&nbsp;(<em>rigidity in space</em>), and <em>precession</em>&nbsp;(perpendicular force on a gyro causes reaction 90° along the rotation direction).</p>

<p>The HI gyro <em>spins around a horizontal axis</em> and provides aircraft heading information; it is set to the aircraft compass.</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Flight%20Instruments,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Flight%252520Instruments%252520Heading%252520Indicator%252520Langley.gif"></p>

<p>Because of the earth’s rotation, the HI is subject to a <em>precession error</em>&nbsp;of approximately 3° every 15 minutes.</p>

<p>The <em>AI gyro spins around a vertical axis</em> and provides pitch and bank information.</p>

<p>The turn and slip indicator consists of a ball and needle; the ball 
indicates yaw (skid or slip), while the needle indicates direction and <em>rate of turn</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Flight%20Instruments,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Flight%252520Instruments%252520Turn%252520Co-ordinator%252520and%25252.gif"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The gyro of the <em>turn and slip indicator</em>&nbsp;<em>spins around a horizontal axis</em> whereby a turn causes precession and gyro movement, while a spring returns the gyro to neutral when the turn stops.</p>

<p>When the ball is centred, the needle markings indicate a <em>standard rate turn</em>&nbsp;of
 3° per second.&nbsp; Thus a timed turn with the needle on the indicator
 will turn the aircraft 180° in one minute.&nbsp; The turn rate 
indicator (the needle deflection) is accurate <em>only when the ball is centred</em> with rudder (no yaw).&nbsp; This shortcoming is described in the <em>Instrument Procedures Manual</em> as follows:</p>

<p><em>It is important that both the needle and ball are used 
together.&nbsp; The problem associated with using these instruments 
separately is that although the ball will positively indicate that the 
aircraft is slipping or skidding, just which one of these the aircraft 
is doing can only be determined by reference to the needle.&nbsp; 
Furthermore, the needle will not positively indicate a bank 
attitude.&nbsp; An aircraft could be in a bank attitude and yet the 
needle could remain centred or indicate a turn in the opposite 
direction, if controls are not co-ordinated </em>(P. 2-19).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">1</a></p>

<p>Most modern aircraft have a <em>turn co-ordinator</em>&nbsp;where the <em>gyro is canted 35</em><em>°</em> and resultantly indicates <em>accurate turn rate irrespective of the ball position</em> (yaw).</p>

<a id="Slip and Skid Indications"></a><h3>Slip and Skid Indications</h3>

<p><img src="IFR%20Flight%20Instruments,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Flight%252520Instruments%252520Turn%252520Co-ordinator%252520Indicat.gif"></p>

<p><em>A slip occurs if the rate of turn is too slow for the angle of bank</em>—the ball is displaced to the inside of a turn as there is a lack of centrifugal (outward) force.</p>

<p>A slip&nbsp;is corrected by decreasing the angle of bank or using 
rudder to increase the rate of turn (or a combination of both).</p>

<p><em>A skid occurs if the rate of turn is too fast for the angle of bank</em>—in this case excessive centrifugal force&nbsp;pushes the ball to the outside of the turn.</p>

<p>A skid&nbsp;is corrected by increasing the angle of bank or using 
rudder to decrease the rate of turn (or a combination of both).</p>

<a id="Turns and Turn Indications"></a><h3>Turns and Turn Indications</h3>

<p>When two aircraft are turning using the <em>same angle of bank</em>, the <em>slower aircraft has the shorter turning radius and the highest rate of turn</em>.&nbsp;
 For example, if two aircraft are turning using a 20° bank, the faster 
is travelling at 350 KTS, and the slower travelling at 130 KTS, the 
faster will take approximately 5.3 minutes to complete a 360° turn, 
while the slower will complete the same turn in only two minutes.</p>

<p>The <em>relationship between radius of turn</em><em>&nbsp;and airspeed varies exponentially</em>—since
 the speed of a 350 knot aircraft is almost three-times faster than the 
speed of 130 knot aircraft, the radius of its turn will be approximately
 nine-times bigger than the radius required for the 130 knot aircraft.</p>

<a id="Control and Performance Instruments"></a><h3>Control and Performance Instruments</h3>

<p><img src="IFR%20Flight%20Instruments,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Flight%252520Instruments%252520Performance%252520and%252520Control%252.gif"></p>

<p>For the purposes of instrument scanning, the standard panel array is 
divided into two groups—those instruments that provide information on 
the aircraft behaviour are referred to as <em>performance instruments</em>, while those instruments that are used to change the behaviour of the aircraft are referred to as <em>control instruments</em>.&nbsp;
 The performance instruments are the airspeed indicator, the turn 
co-ordinator, the heading indicator, the altimeter, and the vertical 
speed indicator, while control instruments are the attitude indicator 
and the manifold pressure or RPM gauge.&nbsp; Here is a summary:</p>

<p><em>When the performance instruments show unwanted change in 
performance, your attention must be directed to the control instruments 
to allow you to make the required changes.&nbsp; For example, if the 
performance instruments indicate that the heading or the altitude has 
changed, attention is directed to the control instruments (attitude 
indicator and/or tachometer) while adjusting attitude and power 
sufficiently to make a correction.&nbsp; You then confirm that the 
required correction is in progress by referring again to the performance
 instruments.</em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title=""><em>2</em></a></p>

<p>It is in relation to the control and performance group that the statement&nbsp; <strong><em>“attitude plus power equals performance.”</em></strong>&nbsp;
 That is, if either the attitude indicator or manifold pressure 
indications are changed, corresponding changes in aircraft performance 
will result.</p>

<a id="Selective Radial Scan"></a><h3>Selective Radial Scan</h3>

<p>The concept of a <em>Selective Radial Scan</em>&nbsp;describes what is considered to be the most <em>natural</em>, yet <em>practical</em> pattern of instrument scanning. &nbsp;It draws attention to the fact that the <em>attitude indicator</em>
 is the hub of the scan pattern, and that the pilot must selectively 
move between supportive instrument displays depending on the flying 
tasks at hand.&nbsp; Accordingly, while attitude indicator information 
is supported by altimeter and heading indications in straight and level 
flight, the attitude indicator is supported by airspeed and heading 
indications during a straight climb.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Flight%20Instruments,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Flight%252520Instruments%252520Selective%252520Radial%252520Scan%25252.gif"></p>

<p>Note that in straight and level flight the primary source for pitch 
information is the altimeter, while during climbs and descents pitch 
information is derived from the airspeed indicator.</p>

<a id="Magnetic Compass"></a><h2>Magnetic Compass</h2>

<p>The compass is mounted usually in acid-free kerosene&nbsp;that dampens movement.</p>

<p>There are <em>two primary errors</em> associated with a compass—<em>compass deviation</em>&nbsp;and <em>magnetic dip</em>.</p>

<p>Compass deviation is deviation errors of the compass caused by the <em>aircraft’s magnetic fields</em>.&nbsp; It is checked regularly as part of aircraft maintenance.&nbsp; Effects of deviation are minimised by <em>corrector magnets</em>&nbsp;attached
 to the compass housing, while the remaining deviation errors are 
recorded and displayed in the cockpit on the compass deviation card.</p>

<p>Headings flown by the pilot are corrected for magnetic variations <em>and</em> for compass deviation.</p>

<p>The compass also has errors because of <em>magnetic dip</em>.&nbsp; 
At the earth’s equator, magnetic lines run parallel to the earth’s 
surface, but towards the north and south poles, the lines “dip” towards 
the surface and gradually become vertical.&nbsp; As the needle of a 
compass attempt to align itself with these descending magnetic lines, it
 too attempts to dip.&nbsp; To minimise this effect, the compass is 
mounted as a <em>pendulum</em> (“pendulous mounting”), but two errors remain related to magnetic dip—<em>Northerly Turning Error</em>, and the <em>Acceleration/Deceleration Error</em>.</p>

<p>The <strong><em>Northerly Turning</em></strong> <strong><em>Error</em></strong>&nbsp;occurs
 during shallow turns through southerly and northerly headings.&nbsp; As
 a rule, the compass “leads” when turning from southerly headings, and 
“lags” when turning from northerly headings.&nbsp; There is 
approximately no turning error when turning east and west headings.</p>

<p>The <strong><em>Acceleration/Deceleration Error</em></strong>&nbsp;occurs
 on easterly and westerly headings whereby acceleration causes the 
compass to show a northerly error, and deceleration causes a southerly 
error.&nbsp; Remember this by “ANDS.”&nbsp; There is approximately no 
such error on northerly and southerly headings.</p>
