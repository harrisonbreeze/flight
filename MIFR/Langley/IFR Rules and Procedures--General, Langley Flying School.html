<p><img alt="Written IFR Clearances, Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Written%2520Clearances.gif"></p>

<p>All IFR traffic in controlled airspace must conform to routings and 
altitudes determined by ATC.&nbsp; In essence, ATC maintains the <em>big picture</em>
 concerning the proximity of&nbsp; “blind” aircraft within specified 
jurisdictions—e.g., Control Zones, Terminal Control Areas, sectors, 
etc.&nbsp; Through the issue of clearances to individual aircraft, ATC 
maintains “separation” between IFR aircraft.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">1</a></p>

<a id="Jurisdiction"></a><h3>Jurisdiction</h3>

<p>IFR clearances issued by a controller only apply to <em>controlled airspace</em>.&nbsp;
 Controllers do not have jurisdiction over IFR flights outside 
controlled airspace—including arrivals and departures from airports 
located in uncontrolled airports.&nbsp; Conversely, IFR pilots cannot 
operate in controlled airspace—any Class of controlled airspace—unless 
they have a clearance to do so.&nbsp; IFR pilots are unrestricted in 
uncontrolled airspace, but of course there is no separation assurance.</p>

<a id="The Contract"></a><h3>The Contract</h3>

<p>IFR clearances in controlled&nbsp;airspace are perhaps best viewed as a <em>contractual agreement</em>—the
 controller assures safe traffic and terrain separation provided IFR 
pilots comply with the terms of a clearance.&nbsp; The controller’s 
ability to maintain a safe IFR environment is dependent upon pilot 
compliance and adherence.</p>

<a id="Verbalisation"></a><h3>Verbalisation</h3>

<p>All IFR clearances are communicated <em>verbally</em> between 
controllers and pilots.&nbsp; Even those clearances that appear in a 
written format—such as appear on the right—must be verbally assigned by 
the controller and accepted by the pilot.</p>

<a id="Impromptu"></a><h3>Impromptu</h3>

<p>A great portion of clearances issued and received are <em>impromptu</em>
 in nature—i.e., they are assigned by controllers in response to 
specific circumstances and situations related to air traffic—the 
controller’s “plot”—at a given time.&nbsp; Since the plot is always 
changing with time, circumstances and situations faced by controllers 
are always changing.&nbsp; The controller must mitigate the needs of 
individual pilots with the collective needs of others sharing the same 
airspace.</p>

<a id="Dynamic"></a><h3>Dynamic</h3>

<p>From the perspective of a pilot conducting an IFR flight, clearances must be viewed as something that is <em>dynamic</em> rather than <em>static</em>.&nbsp; By this it is meant that <em>clearance content is regularly changed or modified during the course of a flight</em>.&nbsp; It is a paramount rule for all IFR that the last clearance received and acknowledged by the pilot <em>supersedes</em> <em>all related items received in previous clearances</em>.&nbsp; While a pilot may submit a flight plan that contains what appears as a <em>static</em>
 plan of action, based on proposed routings and altitudes, the actual 
routings and altitudes that are flown during the actual flight will be 
changed and modified by successive clearances throughout the 
flight.&nbsp; IFR pilots must therefore be adaptive and flexible.</p>

<a id="Choreography"></a><h3>Choreography</h3>

<p>At its best, IFR clearances are a wonderful <em>choreography</em> 
involving pilot-controller co-ordination.&nbsp; The process of sending 
and receiving clearances and clearance requests contains a combination 
of predictable patterns and routines, on the one hand, and improvised 
teamwork, on the other.&nbsp; When the exchange of clearances is done 
well by those involved, it is fluid and efficient; when the exchange 
isn’t done so well, it can become cumbersome and often 
inefficiency.&nbsp; Interfacing smoothly with a controller is important 
and something that is developed with experience.</p>

<a id="Efficiency"></a><h3>Efficiency</h3>

<p>The exchange of clearances varies with the density of traffic.&nbsp; 
When IFR traffic is dense—lots of IFR in the controller’s plot—the 
pattern of pilot-controller communication must become efficient and 
economical if it is to be effective.&nbsp; Pilot must recognise 
variations in controller workload and adapt their radio communication 
accordingly.</p>

<a id="The Master Clearance"></a><h2>The <em>Master</em> Clearance</h2>

<p>It is useful to regard IFR clearances as falling into one of two 
categories.&nbsp; On the one hand, each IFR flight must have what may be
 referred to as a <em>master clearance</em>.&nbsp; Essentially, the 
master clearance specifies the overall routing, altitudes, and or 
procedures that essentially govern the entire flight.&nbsp; It is the <em>big picture</em> or the <em>overall plan of action</em>
 for the flight that spans the departure, en route, and arrival phases 
of the flight.&nbsp; The master clearance provides guidance to the pilot
 in the event that all communication with ATC is lost—both the pilot and
 ATC maintain a written record of the master clearance, and the <em>flight is expected to be executed by the pilot in accordance with the master clearance should a communication failure occur</em>.&nbsp;
 For this reason, the master clearance is the first clearance issued by 
ATC at the beginning of a flight, which, prior to takeoff, establishes 
the planned or expected routings, altitudes, and procedures that are to 
be anticipated.&nbsp; The master clearances are sometimes modified 
during a flight.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="IFR Clearance, Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Vancouver%2520to%2520Calgary%2520via%2520V304.gif"></p>

<p>On the other hand, there are, during the course of the flight, a series of what are perhaps best described as <em>sub-clearances</em>.&nbsp;
 Sub-clearances lead to temporary or brief divergence from the master 
plan, but they do not amend or modify the master clearance 
content.&nbsp; Receiving radar vectors&nbsp;and altitude assignments 
during a departure climb, for example, are sub-clearances.&nbsp; The 
departures heading vectors and altitude assignments are temporary 
clearance, and the pilot will eventually be cleared to intercept and 
resume the routing and altitudes specified in the master clearance.</p>

<p>As was mentioned, a master clearance for an IFR flight is established
 by the controller and the pilot prior to an IFR departure.&nbsp; 
Specifically, the master clearance is almost always communicated in the <em>first radio exchange between the pilot and a controller</em>.&nbsp;
 Consider, for example, a pilot who files an IFR flight plan from 
Vancouver to Calgary.&nbsp; The pilot, we shall say, has file V304 at 
15000’.&nbsp; When contact is first made with ATC prior to the IFR 
departure from a controlled airport—in the case of Vancouver Airport, 
this contact is with the Clearance Delivery&nbsp;controller—the pilot 
must report the destination airport and the flight plan altitude.&nbsp; 
This first communication might therefore go as follows:</p>

<p><strong><em>“Vancouver Clearance Delivery, this is ABC at Apron 2 with Information Echo.&nbsp; IFR Calgary, 13000.”</em></strong></p>

<p>Essentially, the pilot is requesting the <em>master clearance</em> 
for the flight based on the flight plan that has been submitted. 
&nbsp;In response, ATC—via Clearance Delivery—will confirm the routing 
as filed, or will provide a modified routing.&nbsp; In either case, the 
response of ATC, when accepted by the pilot, will become the master 
clearance that will govern the flight to Calgary.&nbsp; Here are some 
sample responses that ATC could provide:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle">
			<p><strong><em>“ATC clears ABC to the CalgaryAirport as filed.”</em></strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><strong><em>2</em></strong></a></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The flight plan submitted by the pilot is approved by ATC in its 
entirety.&nbsp; The routing submitted by the pilot—V304 at 15000’—now 
becomes the agreed upon master clearance.&nbsp; Should the pilot have a 
communication failure at the precise moment of takeoff, the pilot and 
ATC know that this routing will be flown to Calgary Airport.</p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="vertical-align:middle">

<a id="Sub-clearances"></a><h3>Sub-clearances</h3>

<p>While the master clearance provides the overall ATC-approved plan for
 a flight, the pilot will receive during the course of a flight a series
 of <em>sub-clearance</em> that do not modify a master clearance, but 
are instead provided as a temporary change in the routing, usually to 
facilitate safe separation.&nbsp; Here are some examples:</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>“ABC, vectors for traffic.&nbsp; Turn left, heading 040.”</em></strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>A sub-clearance of this nature is common during a departure from 
airport with terminal radar facilities; the controller is modifying 
routing of traffic for separation purposes.&nbsp; The pilot is 
temporarily taken off the normal navigation route established in the 
master plan.&nbsp; When the controller is ready to turn the aircraft 
back on course, the pilot will receive a clearance similar to the 
following: <strong><em>“ABC, turn right 120 degrees.&nbsp; Intercept V300 on course.”</em></strong></p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>“ABC, climb to maintain 14000.&nbsp; Cross Stave Intersection at or above 9000.”</em></strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Again, this clearance relates to the controller’s need to maintain
 separation during a departure.&nbsp; Presumably there is converging 
traffic and the controller requires that the pilot be at or above 9000’ 
by the time a specified fix is reached.</p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>“ABC, maintain 9000 for now, expect 17000 at Stave.”</em></strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Once again, this clearance reflects the controller’s need to 
maintain separation from converging traffic.&nbsp; The expectation for a
 higher altitude is likely provided because 9000’ will not meet MEA 
requirements past Stave Intersection, and the pilot will know to climb 
to 11000 prior to passing Stave should a communication failure 
occur.&nbsp; Note that the master clearance remains valid—if a 
communication failure occurs, the pilot will resort to the routing and 
altitudes specified in the master clearance.</p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>“ABC, I have a hold clearance when your ready to copy . . .”</em></strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>A hold clearance at an en route fix could be issued by ATC as a 
result of delays.&nbsp; While arrival at the destination will be 
delayed, the routing in the master clearance is not affected.</p>
			</td>
		</tr></tbody></table><a id="Clearance Limit"></a><h2>Clearance Limit</h2>

<p>All clearances have what is referred to a <em>clearance limit</em>—by
 definition, the point to which an aircraft is granted an ATC 
clearance.&nbsp; Clearance limits always exist in master clearances, but
 they occasionally appear in sub-clearances.&nbsp; In the master 
clearance the clearance limit is the destination airport; when a 
clearance limit is provided in a sub-clearance—a hold clearance, for 
example—the pilot is always advised of a time at which the pilot should 
live the sub-clearance limit and continue on with the master clearance 
to the destination airport.</p>

<p>In the event that a pilot reaches a clearance limit and a further 
clearance is not received, the pilot should begin a hold procedure at 
the clearance limit and requires further clearance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The responsibility rests with the pilot to determine whether or 
not a received clearance can be complied with in the event of a 
communications failure.&nbsp; Under such circumstances, a clearance may 
be refused, but such refusal should specify acceptable alternatives. 
&nbsp;</em>(<em><a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/CivilAviation/publications/tp14371/RAC/8-0.htm#8-10">AIM</a></em><a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/CivilAviation/publications/tp14371/RAC/8-0.htm#8-10">, RAC 8.10</a>)</p>

<p>Clearance limits are always associated with hold clearance.&nbsp; The
 pilot flying from Vancouver to Calgary, for example, might receive a 
hold clearance as follows:</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>ATC:</em></strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong><em>“ABC, hold clearance when you are ready to copy.</em></strong></p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>Pilot:</em></strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong><em>“Go ahead for ABC.”</em></strong></p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>ATC:</em></strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong><em>“ABC is cleared to the Turny Intersection to hold 
southwest, inbound on Victor 305. Maintain 11000.&nbsp; Expect further 
clearance at 2015.”</em></strong></p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>Pilot:</em></strong></p>

			<td>
			<p><strong><em>“Cleared to the Turny Intersection to hold southwest,

<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">1</a> The vertical 
separation of aircraft that ATC must maintain is 1000’ at and below 
FL290, and 2000’ above Fl290.&nbsp; Lateral separation varies with the 
phase of flight and ATC communication and radar equipment, and can be 
based on time, distance, or specified areas based on the type of 
manoeuvres being flown, referred to as “airspace to be protected” (<em>AIP</em> RAC 6.4).&nbsp; Within a terminal control environment, lateral separation can be as low as 3 NM.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">2</a> For reasons of 
clarity, routine items normally associated with a departure 
clearance—e.g., squawk code and assigned initial frequencies—are not 
included in the examples.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">4</a> While this is rare, it sometimes happens, and creates quite a bit of improvised work on the part of the pilot.</p>

<a id="Clearance Rules"></a><h2>Clearance Rules</h2>

<p>An ATC clearance therefore consists of three elements—altitude, 
routing, and a limit.&nbsp; The altitude and routing is readily 
apparent—<strong><em>“ABC, climb present heading.&nbsp; Maintain 4000.&nbsp; Through 3000, cleared to the Victoria VOR via direct.” </em></strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">1</a></p>

<a id="Read-backs"></a><h3>Read-backs</h3>

<p>IFR clearances must always be read back.&nbsp; The idea, of course, 
is that this will prevent misinterpretation.&nbsp; The best policy is to
 repeat the clearance text back to the controller verbatim, adding the 
aircraft identification.&nbsp; Thus with respect to the above clearance,
 the verbatim read-back would be as follows: <strong><em>“Climb present heading. &nbsp;Maintain 4000.&nbsp; Through 3000, cleared to the Victoria VOR via direct, ABC.”</em></strong></p>

<p>The one exception to the read-back rule pertains to departure clearances containing reference to a <em>Standard Instrument Departure</em>&nbsp;(SID).&nbsp;
 When such a clearance is provided, the pilot need only repeat the 
aircraft call sign and the assigned transponder code.&nbsp; If there is a
 perceived need for clarity, the pilot may respond with a full 
read-back, or the controller may request this.&nbsp; Here at the two 
possible read-backs to a departure clearance containing a SID:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Readback%2520options.gif"></p>

<a id="Conformity and Compliance"></a><h3>Conformity and Compliance</h3>

<p>Remember that the pilot must comply with a clearance once it is 
acknowledged; if a clearance is not acceptable, the pilot must 
immediately notify ATC.</p>

<p>Pilots must always comply and conform with a clearance, the one 
exception to this being emergencies.&nbsp; If the pilot does deviate for
 this reason, the emergency&nbsp;must be such that <em>immediate</em> deviation is required; otherwise, the pilot must immediately advise ATC of the emergency status <em>before</em> a deviation takes place.</p>

<a id="IFR in VMC"></a><h3>IFR in VMC</h3>

<p>An IFR clearance only provides separation between IFR traffic.&nbsp; 
Therefore, in VMC conditions, IFR pilots must provide their own 
separation from VFR traffic.</p>

<p>IFR clearances can include VFR component—e.g., to depart, climb, or 
descend VFR—but this can only be provided by ATC if the pilot requests 
it and weather conditions permit it.&nbsp; Such clearances cannot be 
provided in Class A or B airspace.</p>

<p>When a pilot requests a VFR departure without an IFR clearance, ATC 
approval will include instructions on when and where the pilot is to 
contact ATC for the IFR clearance.</p>

<a id="Emergencies and Communication Failures"></a><h2>Emergencies and Communication Failures</h2>

<p>ATC is authorised to provide all sorts of extra assistance in the 
event of an emergency, but the pilot must first clearly communicate that
 an emergency exists.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the Code 7700&nbsp;is only detectable in SSR<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">2</a> Radar areas.</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Drawing1.gif"></p>

<p>The rules with respect to communication failure procedures are governed by the general provision of “<em>good judgement</em>”—that
 is, pilots are expected to exercise good judgement in response to the 
reality that all circumstances that a pilot might be faced with cannot 
be covered by regulation.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">3</a></p>

<p>The general rules and procedures for communication failures outlined 
below may be superseded by specific procedures contained, for example, 
in a <em>Standard Instrument Departure</em> .</p>

<a id="Communications Failure—General Requirements"></a><h3>Communications Failure—General Requirements</h3>

<p>Generally, the pilot shall, when faced with a communications 
failure&nbsp;in controlled airspace in IFR condition, or when operating 
in Class B or C airspace in VFR:</p>

<ul><li>
	<ul><li>selected Code 7600;</li>
		<li>maintain a listening watch on appropriate frequencies and 
acknowledge such messages by any available means (including selective 
use of normal/standby transponder functions);</li>
		<li>attempt to contact any ATC facility;</li>
		<li>comply with CAP/JEP and CFS provisions;</li>
		<li>attempt to contact ATC by a cellular telephone.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><a id="Communications Failure in VMC"></a><h3>Communications Failure in VMC</h3>

<p>If on an IFR Flight Plan in VFR weather, or if VFR conditions are 
encountered after a communications failure occurrence, the pilot shall 
land as soon as practicable.</p>

<p>The interpretation of “<em>as soon as practicable</em>” is applied here in that extended IFR operation in controlled airspace in VFR weather is to be avoided.&nbsp; However, “<em>as soon as practicable</em>” does not imply “<em>as soon as possible</em>” in that the pilots retain the prerogative of exercising “<em>good judgement</em>”
 and is therefore not required to land at an unauthorised airport, an 
airport that is unsuitable, or a different airport only minutes short of
 the destination airport.</p>

<a id="Communications Failure&nbsp; in IMC"></a><h3>Communications Failure&nbsp; in IMC</h3>

<p>If the communications failure occurs in IMC or the VMC provisions above cannot be complied with the pilot shall</p>

<ul><li>With respect to <strong><em>routing</em></strong>,

	<ul><li>by the last routing assigned by ATC and acknowledged by the pilot;</li>
		<li>in the event of radar vectors, by the direct route from the point 
of communications failure to the fix, route, or airway specified in a 
vector clearance;</li>
		<li>in the absence of an ATC assigned route, by the by the route ATC has indicated may be expected in a further clearance; or,</li>
		<li>in the absence of an assigned or expected route, the routing set out in the filed flight plan.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>With respect to <strong><em>altitude</em></strong>, the highest of the following altitudes for the route segment being flown:
	<ul><li>the altitude last assigned by ATC and acknowledged by the pilot;</li>
		<li>the minimum IFR altitude;</li>
		<li>the altitude that ATC has advised may be expected (and the climb 
to this expected altitude shall be initiated at the time of specified 
ATC).</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Special Notes:</em></strong></p>

<p>The intention of these altitude provisions is to ensure obstacle clearance.</p>

<p>If the communications failure&nbsp;occurs during <strong><em>vectoring</em></strong>
 at a vectoring altitude&nbsp;that is lower than the published minimum 
IFR altitude, the pilot shall immediately climb and maintain the 
published minimum IFR altitude until arrival at the fix, route or airway
 specified in the IFR clearance.</p>

<ul><li>With respect to <strong><em>approach descents</em></strong>, 
maintain the en route altitude to the navigation facility or approach 
fix to be used for the instrument approach, and begin the appropriate 
descent procedure at whichever of the following times is the most 
recent:

	<ul><li>the estimated ETA (from takeoff time plus the filed or amended time en route);</li>
		<li>the ETA last notified to and acknowledged by ATC, or</li>
		<li>the expected approach time last received and acknowledged.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Special Notes:</em></strong></p>

<p>If holding at a non-approach fix, the pilot should leave the fix at the “<em>expect further clearance</em>”
 time&nbsp;and proceed to a fix at which an approach begins, and begin 
the descent for an approach as close as possible to the ETA as specified
 above.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">1</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a <strong><em><u>non-RNAV STAR</u></em></strong>&nbsp;or profile 
descent&nbsp;clearance has been received, the pilot shall maintain the 
altitudes specified above and proceed to the final approach fix via:</p>

<ul><li>
	<ul><li>the published routings, or</li>
		<li>the published routing to the segment where radar vectors are shown
 to commence, and from there direct to the facility or fix serving the 
assigned or active&nbsp; runway for a straight-in approach if able, or 
the full procedure where published.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p>In the event of an <strong><em><u>RNAV STAR</u></em></strong>, the pilot conforms to <strong><em>both</em></strong> the routing <em>and altitude</em> requirements depicted on the chart and proceeds from the <strong><em>Downwind Termination Waypoint</em></strong> (DTW) to the <em><strong>Final Approach Course Fix </strong></em>(FACF) for a straight-in approach.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">1</a> For this reason, a standard component in a hold clearance is the “expect further clearance,” or “expect approach clearance”—<strong><em>“ABC, cleared direct to the Whatcom Vortac.&nbsp; Maintain 4000.&nbsp; Hold south-west, inbound on the 230</em></strong><strong><em>° Radial.&nbsp; Expect further clearance at 0130Z.”</em></strong></p>

<a id="Communications Failure—Additional Considerations"></a><h3>Communications Failure—Additional Considerations</h3>

<p>Where “<em>Radar required</em>” is specified on an approach 
procedure, guidance during the initial approach segment is provided only
 by ATC.&nbsp; In these cases pilots are encouraged to “<em>dead reckon</em>”
 to the final approach course and conduct a straight-in approach without
 unexpected manoeuvring—this is discussed further, below, with respect 
to Victoria International Airport.</p>

<p>Pilots are encouraged to use cellular telephones and FSS telephone numbers which are published in the CFS.</p>

<p>Communications failure procedures in the U.S. are essentially the same as Canadian procedures.</p>

<a id="Communication Failure Scenarios"></a><h2>Communication Failure Scenarios</h2>

<p>Remember that, in the event of a communications failure, and provided
 your transponder is still sending a functional signal, ATC will do all 
that is necessary to clear the aircraft’s route.&nbsp; This is only 
possible, however, in a radar environment.&nbsp; In a non-radar 
environment, time becomes the rule of the day, and airspace will be 
cleared for you on the basis of your estimated en route and arrival 
time.</p>

<p>In all cases, never make any course or altitude changes that cannot 
be anticipated by ATC.&nbsp; If the basic rules governing IFR 
communication failures are practised—combined with “good 
judgement”—everything will work successfully according to plan.</p>

<p>The bad news is that electrical failures that are restricted to an 
aircraft’s radios would in fact be quite rare.&nbsp; A more likely 
scenario is that the entire nav/com equipment will be unusable, or, even
 worse, that the aircraft’s entire electrical system is unusable.</p>

<p>In the event of an entire electrical generation system is rendered 
unusable, remember that you have limited quantity of electrical energy 
in the battery, and this must therefore be tightly managed.&nbsp; If 
your aircraft has an alternator, you will likely be provided warning of a
 systems failure—an enunciator light, for example.&nbsp; In the case of 
generator-powered aircraft, the generator is more likely to go off line 
without careful and continuous monitoring of cockpit indicators.&nbsp; 
Know before flight how generator malfunctions are indicated to the 
pilot—low voltage light, etc.</p>

<p>Always plan for all-systems failure before an IFR flight.&nbsp; Where
 is the VFR weather?&nbsp; What are the ceilings for the en route 
portion?&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the worst case, all-systems failure scenario, you will be in 
cloud.&nbsp; Initially, you will know your exact position, but as time 
goes by, your reckoning will become less accurate.&nbsp; If the ceilings
 provide opportunity for a safe descent into VFR conditions, time 
management will be critical.&nbsp; If vertical descent from IMC 
conditions is not possible, then you must consider a lateral exit from 
IMC conditions.&nbsp; Then your knowledge of how extensive the weather 
system is becomes crucial—what heading do you fly using your compass to 
exit laterally from IMC conditions?</p>

<a id="En Route Portion"></a><h3>En Route Portion</h3>

<p>This portion of IFR flight is perhaps the most straightforward—the 
routing contained in the flight plan, or last amended by ATC or the 
pilot (communicated and acknowledged) is simply flown.</p>

<p>With respect to any route segment flown, the aircraft must fly at the
 master clearance altitude, or the MEA, whichever is highest.&nbsp; So 
as the fixes are approached along the route, the pilot must scan the map
 to ensure at or above the MEA.</p>

<p>If for any reason the aircraft has been cleared to an altitude that 
is satisfactory for the current route segment, but unsatisfactory for 
segments further along the route—i.e., below the MEA of those 
segments—the pilot should shuttle climb in the hold at the fix located 
at the start of the segment for which a climb to the MEA is required.</p>

<a id="Arrival Portion"></a><h3>Arrival Portion</h3>

<p>Unless a RNAV STAR has been filed or assigned, the en route altitude 
must be maintained to the final approach fix for a selected approach at 
the destination airport (an RNAV STAR requires conformity to depicted 
attitude requirements).</p>

<a id="Langley Departure"></a><h3>Langley Departure</h3>

<p><img src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Langley%2520Departure%2520Procedure.gif"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The departure from Langley Airport is unique in that a master 
clearance is commonly not conveyed to the pilot by ATC prior to 
takeoff.&nbsp; Owing to the close proximity of Langley to the approach 
corridors of Vancouver and Abbotsford airport, pilots departing from 
Langley are simply provided a “no-delay” clearance&nbsp;to the Whatcom 
VORTAC. &nbsp;Here is an example of a clearance exchange between ATC at 
Langley Airport (the Ground Controller) and a pilot planning a training 
flight with Langley Airport as the destination (a round-robin flight):</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>Pilot:</em></strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong><em>“Langley Ground, ABC is at Hangar 4B, Information Bravo, IFR Langley, 3000.”</em></strong></p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>ATC:</em></strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong><em>“ABC, Langley Ground, Roger.&nbsp; Taxi . . . . advise when run-up complete and I will put your clearance on request.”</em></strong><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">5</a></p>

			<p><strong><em>“Ground, ABC has completed the runway.”</em></strong></p>

			<p><strong><em>ATC:</em></strong></p>

			<p><strong><em>ATC:</em></strong></p>

			<p><strong><em>“ATC clears ABC to the Whatcom VORTAC&nbsp; via the

		</tr><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>Pilot:</em></strong></p>

			<p><strong><em>ATC:</em></strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong><em>“ABC, read-back correct.&nbsp; Contact Tower on 119.0 when ready.”</em></strong></p>
			</td>
		</tr></tbody></table><p>The interesting feature here is that the ATC 
unit at Langley Airport has not communicated a master clearance to the 
aircraft.&nbsp; Lacking a verbal master clearance, the pilot must resort
 to the flight plan that was filed prior to start-up—this now becomes 
the master clearance for the flight.&nbsp; The cue “no delay expected” 
is added to the clearance to indicate that the pilot should proceed 
directly into the routing contained in that flight plan.</p>

<p>A second interesting feature is the assigned altitude—2000’.&nbsp; 
This conforms with the published departure procedures published in CAP, 
but the altitude is inadequate beyond the routing—i.e., direct to the 
Whatcom VORTAC.&nbsp; Should a communications failure occur immediately 
after takeoff—more specifically, entering cloud immediately after 
takeoff—the pilot would have to initiate a shuttle climb (in a holding 
pattern) at Whatcom, and once the en route altitude is attained, proceed
 with the routing contained in the flight plan.</p>

<p>Once the handoff to Victoria Terminal occurs, the master clearance is typically provided:</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td>
			<p><strong><em>Pilot:</em></strong></p>

		</tr></tbody></table><a id="Victoria SID Departure"></a><h3>Victoria SID Departure</h3>

<p>Let us now examine the communication failure procedures as they apply
 to an aircraft flying a SID departure—in this case the SID named 
“Victoria”—i.e., the Victoria SID.&nbsp; At the time of writing, the 
Victoria SID is properly referred to as the “Vancouver Three Departure” 
and the number—in this case “Three” will change as the procedure is 
amended and modified in future CAP/JEP publications. Here is the JEP 
depiction of this SID:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Victoria%2520Three%2520Departure.gif"></p>

<p>The depiction contains a plan-view showing the Victoria runways, as 
well as the vicinity airways and navigation aids (fixes).&nbsp; The 
depiction also contains the written description of the departure 
elements at the bottom of the plate, including routing and altitude, and
 in the case of Runway 13, the requirement for visual climb to 500' 
ASL.&nbsp; It is this written description to which the pilot is expected
 to conform after takeoff, and of course it is this description that 
must be briefed by the pilot (for the purpose of comprehension) prior to
 departure. Note as wellthe altitude description also specified when the
 departure controlled is to be contacted—Victoria Terminal, after 
climing through 1000'; with most departure procedures, the frequency 
switch to departure fequency is specified by the tower controller so as 
to facilitate operational need.</p>

<p>The description provides for a “vectored” SID—common at larger airports—whereby the pilot normally maintains<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">6</a>
 the runway heading until contact with the terminal control unit is made
 and the aircraft is assigned vectors and altitudes that lead to the “on
 course”—indicted by the line of arrow heads.</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Victoria%2520Aiport--expect%2520radar%2520vectors.gif"></p>

<p>What is important with respect to communication failure procedures is the provision that we are to <em>“expect
 radar vectors to filed/assigned route or depicted fix and clearance to 
flight planned altitude/flight level 10 minutes after departure.”</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Victoria%2520Three%2520Departure%2520text%2520description.gif"></p>

<p>Until the 10 minutes has expired, we are only cleared to maintain 
3000’.&nbsp; After this time, we must immediately begin a climb to the 
assigned or flight plan altitude, and simultaneously turn the aircraft 
so as to intercept the en route airway—again, the airway either assigned
 or flight planned.</p>

<p>It is possible that a departure controller holds you below 3000’ for 
the purpose of safe separation.&nbsp; Since the vectoring altitude is 
below the published altitude, a pilot experiencing a communication 
failure who has been held below 3000 should plan to immediately climb 
and maintain 3000 to wait-out the expiration of the 10 minutes.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">7</a></p>

<a id="Victoria DUNCN STAR Arrival"></a><h3><strong>Victoria DUNCN STAR Arrival</strong></h3>

<p>What is required in the event that a communication failure occurs to 
an aircraft, the flight plan for which includes a STAR, or a STAR has 
been assigned?&nbsp; Below is Jeppesen's depiction of the DUNCN STAR 
into Victoria International Airport:</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Victoria%2520DUNCN%2520Arrival.gif"></p>

<p>Again, like the SID, we have a plan-view of the DUNCN routing, 
including the navigation aids used to define the route.&nbsp; We are 
also given a written description of the clearance at the bottom of the 
chart, which summaries the routing depicted. To the right of the routing
 discriptive text, we have the altitude portion of the clearance.&nbsp; 
Note that since this is a non-RNAV STAR, the altitude to be maintain 
when a communcation failure occurs is simply the last assigned. 
Accordingly, we maintain the last assigned altitude and follow the 
depicted track until we get to the "expect radar vectors" point, as 
indicated the line of arrow heads that follow the 160° after crossing 
IRKON intersection. South of IRKON, then, we can begin—in a 
communication failure—self-navigation for the approach.&nbsp; If we 
elect to conduct an approach procedure with a published final approach 
fix, we would proceed directly from the point at which vectors are 
expected to the final approach fix for that approach for the purpose of 
conducting a full procedure turn.&nbsp; In the even that the approach we
 are planning is a “RADAR REQUIRED” approach, then the communication 
procedure rules require that we dead reckon to the final approach 
course.&nbsp; The <em><a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/tp14371-rac-6-0-2602.htm#6-3-2">AIM</a></em> prescribes the following:</p>

<p>Some instrument procedures do not include a procedure turn but 
include the statement “RADAR OR RNAV REQUIRED” as part of the procedure.
 The initial approach segment of these instrument procedures is being 
provided by ATC radar vectors. Without ATC radar vectoring, the 
instrument procedure may not have a published initial approach segment.</p>

<p><br>
Should an aircraft communications failure occur while the aircraft is 
being vectored on one of these approaches, separately or as part of a 
STAR, the pilot is expected to comply with the communications failure 
procedure by selecting the transponder to Mode A/3 Code 7600 
immediately. Pilots should always be aware of the traffic situation. For
 example, ATC may have indicated that your aircraft was second for an 
approach to Runway 06L; under these circumstances, the flight should be 
continued along the route that normally would have been expected under 
radar vectoring. In some cases of communications failure, pilots may 
need to dead reckon, or DR, a route to the final approach course. It is 
important to other aircraft and ATC for the aircraft experiencing a 
communications failure to continue the flight along a route that would 
permit the aircraft to conduct a straight-in approach and landing 
without unexpected manoeuvring. Pilots are expected to exercise good 
judgment in these cases. Unexpected manoeuvres, such as turns away from 
the final approach course, may cause traffic disruptions and conflicts. <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/tp14371-rac-6-0-2602.htm#6-3-2-1"><em>AIM</em></a></p>

<p>What about RNAV STARs? In reality, they are virtually identical, but 
remember that the pilot experiencing a communications failure must 
adhere to altitude requirements depicted in the procedure. Consider the 
DISCO arrival into Victoria:</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/DIACO%2520RNAV%2520STAR.gif"></p>

<p>Note the specifications with respect to altitude requirments, which 
of course becomes mandatory in the case of communications failure, but 
also look at addional instructions for communciation failure which are 
presented to the pilot as "expected clearances". What is further 
interesting in the case of the DISCO Arrival is the fact that this RNAV 
STAR leads to approach procedures for a runway where procedure turns are
 not authorized—the pilot, accordingly, is expected to self-navigate to 
the final approach course, and looking a the plate, the heading to fly 
looks to be about a 350° MH.</p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Victoria%2520Airport%2520Radar%2520or%2520RNAV%2520Required.gif"></p>

<p><img src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/ILS%2520-%2520DME%2520Runway%252007%2520Victoria.gif"></p>

<a id="Vectored Approach"></a><h3><strong><em>Vectored Approach</em></strong></h3>

<p>There are two important things to remember about communication 
failure procedures during a vectoring procedure.&nbsp; Firstly, the 
controller can put you below the published minimum altitudes you would 
normally fly—e.g., a published <em>Minimum Sector Altitude</em> 
(MSA)&nbsp;(see P. 140) or a procedure-turn altitude (see P. 141).&nbsp;
 The lower vectoring altitude can be provided as the controller knows 
exactly where you are relative to terrain.&nbsp; If a communication 
failure should occur, however, you don’t know exactly where you are 
relative to terrain.&nbsp; The rule, therefore, is to immediately climb 
to a published minimum altitude should a communication failure occur 
during vectors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Vectored Approach, Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Vectored%2520Approach.gif"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second important thing to remember about vectored approaches is 
that the tracking that is followed is almost identical to normal circuit
 procedures.&nbsp; Normally, but not always, the vectoring includes a 
down-wind and a base leg.&nbsp; In all cases, however, vectoring ends 
with an “intercept” heading or leg.&nbsp; When the intercept heading is 
provided, the pilot simply maintains the heading until the final 
approach course is intercepted as depicted on the approach plate, 
whether it be a localizer, NDB track, VOR radial, etc.&nbsp; Should the 
communication failure occur during vectoring prior to the intercept 
heading, the pilot must climb to a safe published altitude and proceed 
to the final approach fix for a full procedure.&nbsp; Should the 
communication failure occur after the intercept heading, then there 
should be no change in the altitude or heading and the pilot should 
simply continue to fly and complete the intercept on the final approach 
course.</p>

<a id="Navigatio-aid Malfunctions"></a><h3>Navigatio-aid Malfunctions</h3>

<p>The pilot of an aircraft in IFR flight within controlled airspace 
shall immediately communicate to ATC any malfunction of navigation or 
ATC communication.</p>

<a id="Instrument Procedures Development"></a><h3>Instrument Procedures Development</h3>

<p>There are two existing standards governing the development and design
 of instrument procedures—ICAO Standards (PANS-OPS) and U.S. Standards 
(TERPS).&nbsp; The Canadian standard is outlined in <em>Criteria for the Development of Instrument Procedures</em> (TP 308), which is generally identical to TERPS.</p>

<p>Strict adherence to published instrument procedures will ensure an acceptable level of safety in flight operations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a id="References:"></a><h3><strong>References:</strong></h3>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">1</a> Thus, the pilot holds
 the present heading until climbing through 3000’.&nbsp; After passing 
3000’, the pilot is to continue the climb to 4000’, but track directly 
to the Victoria VOR.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">2</a> Secondary Surveillance Radar—requires a transponder.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">3</a> Note the meaning 
here—where there are communication failure procedures (as outlined 
below), then they must be complied with.&nbsp; Where circumstances of an
 actual communications failure exist, then “good judgement” must be 
exercised by the pilot.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">4</a> For this reason, a standard component in a hold clearance is the “expect further clearance,” or “expect approach clearance”—<strong><em>“ABC,
 cleared direct to the Whatcom Vortac.&nbsp; Maintain 4000.&nbsp; Hold 
south-west, inbound on the 230° Radial.&nbsp; Expect further clearance 
at 0130Z.”</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">5</a> The practice is that 
the Langley Tower unit will not contact the terminal control unit and 
request their approval for the departure until the run-up is completed 
and the aircraft is only a few minutes away from being ready for 
takeoff.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" title="">6</a> A departure turn is required off Runway 30 owing to the higher terrain that lies just north of Vancouver Airport.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7" title="">7</a> You can imagine that 
if a controller has held you down below the published altitude during a 
SID departure is likely doing so for traffic separation reasons—another 
aircraft is probably above you.&nbsp; Before you initiate a climb from a
 held-down altitude, be sure you have followed the proper transponder 
procedures for a communication failure so that other traffic can be 
moved out of the way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a id="IFR Flight Plans"></a><h2>IFR Flight Plans</h2>

<p>It is specified (CAR 602.73) that no pilot-in-command shall operate 
an aircraft in IFR flight unless an IFR flight plan&nbsp;or IFR flight 
itinerary has been filed.&nbsp; An IFR pilot may, however, file an IFR 
flight itinerary instead of an IFR flight plan where</p>

<ul><li>the flight is conducted in whole or in part outside controlled airspace, <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">1</a> or</li>
	<li>facilities are inadequate to permit the communication of a flight plan information to ATS.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">2</a></li>
</ul><a id="When to file"></a><h3>When to file</h3>

<p>IFR flight plans or flight itineraries should be filed as early as 
practicable in or to facilitate ATS entering the flight into the ATS 
data processing system, preferably at least 30 minutes prior to the 
proposed departure time.&nbsp; Filing less than 30 minutes could cause 
delays.</p>

<a id="Changes during flight"></a><h3>Changes during flight</h3>

<p>As soon as practicable, an IFR pilot must notify ATS of any changes 
with respect to the cruising altitude of a flight, the routing of a 
flight, and the destination airport.&nbsp; Additionally, when in 
controlled airspace, the pilot must notify ATS of any change in true 
airspeed where the change is 5% or more of the true airspeed contained 
in an IFR flight plan.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">3</a></p>

<a id="Composite IFR and VFR planning"></a><h3>Composite IFR and VFR planning</h3>

<p>A composite flight plan&nbsp;or flight itinerary is where portions of
 the flight are operated under VFR, and part of the flight is operated 
under IFR.&nbsp; Where IFR governs the first part of the flight, ATC 
will clear the aircraft to the point within controlled airspace where 
the IFR portion ends.&nbsp; Where VFR governs the first part of the 
flight, the pilot is expected to contact ATC for an IFR clearance prior 
to approaching the point at which the IFR portion begins.</p>

<p>If direct contact with ATC is not possible, a pilot may contact FSS and request the clearance.</p>

<a id="Intermediate Stops"></a><h3>Intermediate Stops</h3>

<p>These may not be used on an IFR flight plan.</p>

<a id="Consecutive IFR flight planning"></a><h3>Consecutive IFR flight planning</h3>

<p>Consecutive IFR flight&nbsp;plans can be filed, each of which must 
contain independent information normally required for any flight 
plan.&nbsp; However, there are conditions—the flights must be in Canada,
 and the sequence of stops will fall within one 24-hour period.</p>

<a id="IFR training flight plans"></a><h3>IFR training flight plans</h3>

<p>An IFR training flight plan&nbsp;is defined as a flight where there 
are no intermediate stops and yet one or more instrument approaches will
 be conducted en route.</p>

<p>With respect to IFR training flight plans, the following rules apply:</p>

<ul><li>a single flight plan is filed;</li>
	<li>the en route locations where the practice instrument approach and 
missed approaches are planned shall be listed in the “Other Information”
 section of the flight plan, along with the estimated time required to 
conduct the procedure (i.e., ILS 29 at CYYJ—10 minutes, NDB 07 at 
CYXX—10 minutes).<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">4</a></li>
	<li>the estimated time en route is not to include the estimated time required to carry out the approach at the specified locations.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">5</a></li>
	<li>ATC will normally clear the aircraft to the final destination.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">6</a>.</li>
</ul><a id="Alternate Airport Requirements"></a><h2>Alternate Airport Requirements</h2>

<p>All IFR flights must have a designated “alternate airport” that is 
suitable for use by the aircraft, and this alternate airport must be 
indicated in the Flight Plan or Flight Itinerary.</p>

<p>The most important thing to remember about alternates is that they 
will only be used when the weather is bad.&nbsp; The destination airport
 has gone below IFR minimums, and you are now relying on your alternate 
airport to get safely back on the ground.&nbsp; The planned flight has 
essentially been aborted, and a back-up plan of action is required.</p>

<p>When selecting an alternate, then, you want to make sure it provides a
 solid and secure means of getting out of the weather.&nbsp; When 
possible, it should be an airport with a precision approach, and its 
position should lie between the planned departure and destination 
airports—as opposed to being located, for example, <em>beyond</em> the planned destination.</p>

<p>Two sets of rules govern the selection of an alternate, the first 
relates to fuel requirements, and the second relates to forecasted 
weather requirements.</p>

<a id="Alternate Fuel Requirements"></a><h3>Alternate Fuel Requirements</h3>

<p>The fuel requirements for IFR aircraft establish that the aircraft 
shall carry an amount of fuel&nbsp;that is sufficient to allow the 
aircraft to complete the following:</p>

<ul><li><strong><em>In the case of a propeller-driven aircraft,</em></strong>

	<ul><li>where the alternate airport is specified in a flight plan or 
flight itinerary, to fly to the destination airport and execute an 
approach and a missed approach, and then fly to and land at the 
alternate airport, and then fly for an additional period of 45 minutes, 
or</li>
		<li>when an alternate airport is not specified in a flight plan or 
flight itinerary, to fly to the destination airport and execute an 
approach and a missed approach, and then to fly for an additional period
 of 45 minutes.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">7</a></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><em><strong>In the case of turbojet powered aircraft,</strong></em>
	<ul><li>where the alternate airport is specified in a flight plan or 
flight itinerary, to fly to the destination airport and execute an 
approach and a missed approach, and then fly to and land at the 
alternate airport, and then fly for an additional period of 30 minutes, 
or</li>
		<li>when an alternate airport is not specified in a flight plan or 
flight itinerary, to fly to the destination airport and execute an 
approach and a missed approach, and then to fly for an additional period
 of 30 minutes.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><a id="Alternate Weather Requirements"></a><h3>Alternate Weather Requirements</h3>

<p>The weather for the designated alternate, based on available weather 
information, must indicate that the ceiling and ground visibility will 
be, at the expected time of arrival, at or above the alternate airport 
weather minima criteria.</p>

<p>The following specifies alternate minima:</p>

		</tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The correct interpretation of this table is important, and there are a
 number of points that must be elaborated upon and properly understood.</p>

<a id="General Provisions"></a><h3>General Provisions</h3>

<p>The selection of applicable minima for an aircraft (i.e., the 
application of the above table) shall be consistent with the performance
 of the aircraft used, the navigation equipment on board and the 
aircraft (and its limitations), the nature of the weather forecasts 
available, and the airport runway(s) to be used.</p>

<a id="GPS Restriction"></a><h3>GPS Restriction</h3>

<p>An airport with only GPS approaches available cannot be used to file as an alternate.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">8</a></p>

<a id="Precision and Non-precision Approaches"></a><h3>Precision and Non-precision Approaches</h3>

<p>In order to apply the alternate minima requirements, we must first 
understand the difference between a precision approach, on the one hand,
 and a non-precision approach, on the other.</p>

<p>Only ILS and PAR approaches qualify as <strong><em>precision approaches</em></strong>.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">9</a>&nbsp;
 They generally have the lowest minima of all published procedures and 
they allow for the most precise positioning of the aircraft just prior 
to landing.&nbsp; Precision approaches are the only approach procedures 
that have a published <strong><em>decision height</em></strong> 
(DH).&nbsp; The DH&nbsp;is a specified horizontal plan above the runway 
threshold where the electronic glide path and localizer intercept.&nbsp;
 The aircraft is in a <em>descending attitude</em> only seconds from 
touchdown (where visual reference with the runway is made).&nbsp; In 
contrast, an aircraft reaches the threshold area of runway with far less
 precision and accuracy with a non-precision approach.&nbsp; 
Non-precision approaches have <strong><em>minimum descent altitudes </em></strong><em>(MDAs)</em>, rather than DHs, and the aircraft reaches the threshold area in a <em>level attitude</em>.&nbsp;
 Only when the required visual reference with the runway is established 
can the pilot initiate the final descent that leads to touchdown.&nbsp; 
In many cases—i.e., during circling approaches—the pilot must circle the
 airport area prior to beginning the final descent.&nbsp; In short, 
non-precision approaches—NDB, VOR, Localizer, GPS are a lot less 
precise—accordingly, the weather minima required for using an airport 
with only a non-precision&nbsp;</p>

<p>approach are much higher.</p>

<p>As is evident, the lowest alternate minima are provided only for 
airports equipped with precision approaches, rather than non-precision 
approaches.&nbsp; The alternate minima are even <em>lower</em> were the airport is equipped with multiple precision approaches.</p>

<a id="Separate Runways"></a><h3>Separate Runways</h3>

<p>In order to apply the alternate minima requirements above, we must also understand what is meant by the expression <em>two separate suitable runways</em>.</p>

<p>Separate runways means separate <strong><em>runway surfaces</em></strong>.&nbsp; Accordingly, an airport equipped with two precision approaches at <em>either end of one runway surface</em>—Victoria
 Airport’s Runways 09 and 27, for example—would not qualify.&nbsp; 
Vancouver Airport, however, would potentially qualify, as there are 
three runway surfaces, each of which has a precision approach.</p>

<a id="Usable Runways"></a><h3>Usable Runways</h3>

<p>To satisfy the meaning of <strong><em>separate and suitable</em></strong> runways, the runway surface themselves must be <em>usable</em>.&nbsp;
 If, for example, the forecasted crosswind forecast for the parallel 
runways at Vancouver Airport exceed the practical limits of an aircraft,
 then there would not be two separate yet usable precision approaches, 
and the minimum for two precision approaches could not be used.&nbsp; 
Similarly, if the crosswinds forecast for the one precision approach 
runway at Abbotsford are excessive, then the minima applicable for one 
usable precision approach could not be used.&nbsp; You would in the case
 of Abbotsford have to use the non-precision minimum based on circling 
minima&nbsp;(as a circling manoeuvre for the into-wind runways—Runways 
01 or 19—would have to be used.</p>

<p>Remember that usability of a runway could be affected by many things 
including runway contamination owing to snow, runway closure for 
maintenance, or navigation aid outage.&nbsp; Hence the importance of 
conducting a full weather and NOTAM check for your alternate airport.</p>

<a id="The HAT and the VIS"></a><h3>The HAT and the VIS</h3>

<p>The use of HAT&nbsp;(<em>Height above Touch-down Zone</em>) and 
visibility is straightforward.&nbsp; In the case of precision 
approaches, the HAT is based on the distance from the published <em>DH</em> to the Touchdown Zone Elevation.&nbsp; For non-precision approaches, HAT<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">10</a> is based on the published <em>Minimum Descend Altitude</em>
 and its height above the touchdown zone.&nbsp; The visibility 
requirement for alternate minima are based on the published advisory or 
recommended visibilities published for each approach.</p>

<a id="The Sliding Scale"></a><h3>The Sliding Scale</h3>

<p>The last aspect of alternate minima relates to the ability to trade 
HAT for visibility.&nbsp; That is, the pilot is given latitude in that 
if good visibility is forecast for the alternate airport, the required 
HAT value can be reduced.&nbsp; This only occurs, however, if the 
alternate minima values for the selected airport qualify as <strong><em>standard alternate minima</em></strong>.&nbsp;
 The standard alternate minima are 600’ and 2 SM, in the case of an 
airport with one usable precision approach, and 800’ and 2 SM, in the 
case of an airport with a usable non-precision approach.&nbsp; Here is 
how it works:</p>

		</tr></tbody></table><p>So, if after doing the alternate minima math, you establish that your ceiling and visibility values are <em>standard</em>,
 you may still use the airport as an alternate even though the forecast 
visibilities are less than 2 SM.&nbsp; In order to apply the lesser 
visibilities, however, the forecasted ceilings must be higher than the 
standard values as indicated above.&nbsp; If, for example, you are 
evaluating an airport as an alternate and it has forecast visibility of 
only 1 SM, this can still be filed and used as an alternate provided the
 ceiling is greater than 1000’.&nbsp; If the same airport has a usable 
precision approach, the forecasted ceiling can be as low as 800’.</p>

<p>Note the sliding scale provision&nbsp;is not applicable to alternate airports with two separate and usable precision approaches.</p>

<a id="Abbotsford as an Alternate"></a><h3>Abbotsford as an Alternate</h3>

<p>Let us now look at the application of the alternate minima, as they would apply to Abbotsford Airport.</p>

<p>In the first case, let us assume that the ILS approach at Abbotsford 
is in fact usable.&nbsp; The depiction on the right is based on what 
appears in the minima box in the lower left-hand corner for the ILS 07.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Abbotsford ILS 07 Minima Box.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Abbotsford%2520Minimum%2520Box.gif"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="IFR Aircraft Categories.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Aircraft%2520Categories.gif"></p>

<p>At the top of the minima box&nbsp;are the four aircraft categories.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">11</a>&nbsp;
 Which category your aircraft falls under is based on the airspeed at 
which your aircraft is going to be manoeuvred when the DH or MDA is 
reached.&nbsp; Accordingly, this speed will vary depending on the 
manoeuvre you are flying.&nbsp; The speed at which you conduct a 
circling manoeuvre (level flight with the gear extended) at the MDA is 
different from the speed at which you would pass the DH only seconds 
from touchdown.&nbsp; The speeds and the respective categories are 
indicated on the right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Importantly, don’t get the manoeuvring speed for the aircraft category confused with Va—the two, of course, are unrelated.</p>

<p>On the left column of Abbotsford ILS approach (above) are the three 
approaches for which minima are published for the ILS 07 plate—the ILS, 
which requires the use of the glideslope and the Localizer, the LOC, 
which requires the Localizer only, and the CIRCLING, which can be 
performed off either the ILS or LOC approach.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">12</a></p>

<p><img alt="ILS Minima, Runway 07, Abbotsford, Langley Flying School" src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/ILS%2520minimum.gif"></p>

<p>To the right of the three approaches are of course the minima.&nbsp; 
In the case of the ILS approach (above), for example, the DH is 470—an 
ASL value—while the HAT is 296—an AGL value.&nbsp; To the far right, the
 recommended visibility is ½ SM, or the equivalent in RVR 
value—2600’.&nbsp; If we are capable of flying the ILS 07 approach in 
the event that Abbotsford is filed as the alternate airport—based on 
aircraft equipment, and forecasted weather for Abbotsford—then it is 
these minima that we must apply to the alternate minima table above.</p>

<a id="The Alternate&nbsp; Math"></a><h3>The Alternate&nbsp; Math</h3>

<ul><li>Note that when dealing with alternate minima, the concept of “<strong><em>whichever is greater</em></strong>” must be applied.&nbsp; That is, the alternate minimum of <em>standard alternate minima</em>, on the one hand, and the <em>specific</em>
 alternate minima values applicable for your selected airport.&nbsp; For
 a selected alternate airport, that is, you have to establish the HAT 
and VIS specific for the approaches, add the alternate minima values to 
these, and then compare these values with the so-called standard 
alternate minima.&nbsp; The alternate minima are 400 and 1 (400-1) for 
airports with <em>multiple precision approaches</em>, 600 and 2 (600-2) for airports with <em>one precision approach</em>, and 800 and two (800-2) for airports with <em>non-precision approach</em>.&nbsp;
 These are fixed and never change.&nbsp; To compare these to the 
specific values for the ILS 07 at Abbotsford, for example, we must take 
the HAT and the VIS published for this approach and add—since there is 
only one precision approach at this airport—300 to the HAT&nbsp; and add
 1 to the VIS.</li>
</ul><ul><li>There is one more thing to consider here.&nbsp; Note that 
the DH&nbsp;or MDA&nbsp;values published for an approach are down to the
 ten-foot values—470’, and 860’, for example.&nbsp; Alternate minima, 
however, are dealt with in one-hundred-foot values— 200’, 300’, 400’, 
etc.&nbsp; Also, forecasted ceilings are published solely in 
one-hundred-foot values.&nbsp; So we must have some means of 
rounding-off the published valued.&nbsp; To do this, we have the “<strong><em>20-foot Rule</em></strong>.”
 According to this rule, a HAT that is published at 420’, for example, 
is rounded down to 400’, while at HAT value of 421’ or higher is rounded
 up—e.g. 500’.&nbsp; Accordingly, while a HAT of 212’ becomes 200’ for 
the purpose of alternate minima calculation, a HAT of 243’ becomes 300’.</li>
</ul><ul><li>So let us examine the application of the math.&nbsp; Let us
 say that Abbotsford Airport is proposed as the alternate.&nbsp; The 
math necessary to determine the applicable minima is as follows:</li>
</ul><ul><li>
	<ul><li>First, determine the usability of the available runways—i.e., 
applicable weather, and NOTAMs.&nbsp; If all the approaches are usable, 
there is only one precision approach and two non-precision approaches 
(the Localizer and the NDB), but they are published for the same runway 
surface.&nbsp; We would prefer to use the precision approach in 
calculating alternate minima, so we have to apply the minima for “one 
usable precision approach.”</li>
	</ul><ul><li>Secondly, assuming unrestricted usability, calculate the lowest usable HAT and visibility:</li>
		<li>The HAT for the ILS 07 is 296’ and the recommended visibility is ½
 SM.&nbsp; For calculation purpose (i.e., the “20-foot rule”), this must
 be rounded up to 300’.</li>
		<li>We now must add the Abbotsford precision approach HAT and 
visibility to the 300-1 required for an alternate airport with one 
usable approach:</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><table class="table table-bordered" style="width:50%"><tbody><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap">
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> 300’&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; ½ SM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

			</td>
			<td style="white-space:nowrap">
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			</td>
		</tr></tbody></table><ul><li>
	<ul><li>Now we must compare the corrected value with the standard 
alternate minima for an alternate airport with one precision 
approach—600’ &amp; 2 SM.&nbsp; Which is the higher of the two?&nbsp; 
The answer is 600’ &amp; 2 SM.&nbsp; Therefore, if we wish to use 
Abbotsford as our alternate airport, the forecasted weather must be a 
ceiling not less than 600’ and visibility not less than 2 SM.&nbsp; Is 
this correct, though?&nbsp; The answer is <em>no</em>.&nbsp; In fact 
600’ and 2 SM is standard alternate minima for an airport with one 
usable precision approach, so we can therefore apply the sliding scale 
minima that will permit either 700’ and 1½ SM, or 800 and 1 SM.&nbsp; So
 the forecast visibility for Abbotsford could be as low as 1 SM, but if 
this is the case we must have a forecast ceiling of not less than 800’.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><a id="Vancouver as an Alternate"></a><h3>Vancouver as an Alternate</h3>

<p>Lets examine the alternate minima for Vancouver Airport—the only 
airport in British Columbia with two separate and usable ILS approaches 
(in fact there are three ILS approaches).&nbsp; We will assume that all 
precision approaches are usable and suitable (note that straight-in 
minima must be provided on two or more separate and suitable runway 
surfaces).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Vancouver Minima Box (Sample).  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Vancouver%2520Minimum.gif"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Referring to the format minimum box the ILS approach to Runway 08L, 
we see the minima box as depicted above.&nbsp; The first thing you will 
note is that we do not get the conventional “<strong>ILS</strong>” in the left-hand column.&nbsp; Instead, we get “<strong>ILS/DME</strong>” and “<strong>ILS/RADAR</strong>”
 notation.&nbsp; What these mean is that this approach lacks an NDB for 
the Final Approach Fix.&nbsp; Instead, DME or ATC radar is used to 
determine final approach fix crossing.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">14</a>&nbsp;
 If you examine the plate, you will see that the Final Approach Fix is 
ROSS intersection, and that this can be determined, in the case of the 
ILS approach, by DME (4 DME)<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">15</a> or by a Radar Fix,<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">16</a>
 or in the case of the LOC approach, by reference to DME, a Radar Fix, 
or the 300° Radial from the Vancouver VORTAC.&nbsp; Despite these 
features of the non-NDB Final Approach Fix, the ILS otherwise remains 
the same as we saw at Abbotsford.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">17</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here, then, is the alternate minima math for Vancouver.&nbsp; The HAT
 value here is an even 200’ so we are not required to apply the 20-foot 
rule.&nbsp; All we do is take the HAT and visibility for this 
approach—200’ and ½ SM—and add this to the HAT and visibility required 
for an alternate equipped with two or more usable precision 
approaches—i.e., 200 &amp; ½ SM:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="width:50%"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="white-space:nowrap">
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 200’&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; ½ SM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			<td colspan="2" style="white-space:nowrap">
			<p>(Vancouver)</p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="white-space:nowrap">

			</td>
			<td colspan="2" style="white-space:nowrap">
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			</td>
		</tr></tbody></table><p>We now compare this to the 400 &amp; 1 value 
(as is required in the alternate minima table) and we see that they are 
the same (there are no higher values to select); therefore the alternate
 minima to use Vancouver as the alternate is 400’ and 1 SM.</p>

<a id="Kamloops as an Alternate"></a><h3>Kamloops as an Alternate</h3>

<p>With respect to alternate airports without a precision approach, let us examine Kamloops Airport&nbsp;as the proposed alternate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Kamloop Minima Box.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Kamloops%2520as%2520an%2520alternate.gif"></p>

<p><img alt="Aircraft Categories.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--General,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Aircraft%2520Categories.gif"></p>

<p>Since exact manoeuvring speed is important in determining the 
alternate minima values at Kamloops, it will be assumed that the flight 
is to be done in a light twin.&nbsp; The <em>manoeuvring speed</em> of the aircraft on <em>final approach</em> is 78 KTS (with full flap), and the <em>manoeuvring speed</em> for a <em>circling approach</em> is 91 KTS with 25° flaps.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">18</a></p>

<p>Since radio navigation equipment is also important in determining 
Kamloops minima as an alternate, it will be further assumed that the 
aircraft is equipped with “standard” radio navigation equipment—VHF, 
ADF, VOR, and ILS.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">19</a>&nbsp; The fact that the aircraft has an ILS is of little value to us since there is not a published ILS for Kamloops.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">20</a></p>

<p>The only approaches to select are the LOC DME or the LOC-B, as they 
appear on one approach plate, or the NDB-A, which appears on a second 
approach plate.&nbsp; Both plates provide minima for circling 
approaches, rather than a straight-in approach<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">21</a>).&nbsp; Since a <em>precision approach</em> does not exist for Kamloops, we must apply the alternate minima for an airport equipped with a <em>non-precision approach</em> (800’ and 2 SM, or 300’ and 1 SM above the lowest HAT and associated visibility, whichever is greater).</p>

<p>In assessing alternate minima values, there are three approaches, and
 therefore three choices. &nbsp;The NDB-A provides a HAT of 2607’, the 
LOC-B provides a HAT of 2047’, and the LOC/DME-B provides a HAT of 1467’
 for Category A aircraft, and 1767’ for Category B aircraft.&nbsp; All 
HAT are published with a recommended visibility of 3 SM.</p>

<p>As is apparent, to get the lowest minima, we must be able to use the 
LOC/DME-B minima with the manoeuvring speeds&nbsp;for Category A.&nbsp; 
Since the manoeuvring speed for Category A can only be achieved by the 
light twin for a straight-in final approach, selecting the lower minima 
published for the LOC/DME-B is contingent on being able to use Runway 
26.&nbsp; If Runway 26 is not usable—because of forecast winds, for 
example—the LOC/DME-B could still be used to calculate alternate minima,
 but the higher Category B values would have to be used—in this case, 
2900’.</p>

<p>Assuming that Runway 26 is usable, and that circling is not required,
 the Category A HAT is 1467’ with 3 SM visibility.&nbsp; Applying the 
20-foot rule, this must be rounded up to 1500’.&nbsp; The alternate 
minima for a non-precision approach are 800’ and 2 SM, or 300’ and 1 SM 
above the lowest usable HAT:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="width:50%"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center; white-space:nowrap">
			<p>1500’&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; 3 SM&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			</td>
			<td style="white-space:nowrap">
			<p>(Kamloops)</p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap">
			<p>&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 300’&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; 1 SM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			</td>
			<td style="white-space:nowrap">
			<p>(Standard correction value for a non-precision approach)</p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap">
			<p><strong>&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1800’&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; 4 SM</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td style="white-space:nowrap">
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			</td>
		</tr></tbody></table><p>Obviously, we must select the higher value—in 
this case 1800’ and 4 SM.&nbsp; This is our minimum weather to use 
Kamloops as an alternate airport.&nbsp; Because the values are not 
standard, we cannot apply the sliding scale.</p>

<a id="Weather Information for Alternate Airports"></a><h2>Weather Information for Alternate Airports</h2>

<p>There are many additional requirements related to the weather and alternate minima.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title="">22</a></p>

<p>The question arises, for example, regarding the application of the 
terms BECMG, TEMPO&nbsp;and PROB, as they appear in a TAF, and how they 
are interpreted relative to alternate minima.&nbsp; The requirements 
read as follows:</p>

<p><em>Aerodrome forecasts (TAFs) that contain the terms BECMG, TEMPO or
 PROB may be used to determine the weather suitability of an aerodrome 
as an alternate provided that:</em></p>

<ul><li>
	<ul><li><em>where conditions are forecast to improve, the forecast 
BECMG condition shall be considered to be applicable at the end of the 
BECMG time period, and these conditions shall not be below the published
 alternate minima requirements for that aerodrome; and</em></li>
		<li><em>where conditions are forecast to deteriorate, the forecast 
BECMG condition shall be considered to be applicable as the start of the
 BECMG time period, and these conditions shall not be below the 
published alternate minima requirements for that aerodrome; and</em></li>
		<li><em>the forecast TEMP condition shall not be below the published alternate minima requirements for that aerodrome; and</em></li>
		<li><em>the forecast PROB condition shall not be below the appropriate landing minima for that aerodrome.</em><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title="">23</a></li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p>Essentially, then, the conditions described in a BECMG and TEMPO part-period shall be interpreted as if the <em>conditions actually exist throughout the times which define the part-period</em>,
 and they must not be below alternate minima.&nbsp; In the case of PROB 
part-periods, however, the applicable weather can be below alternate 
minima, but not below published <em>landing minima</em> for the aerodrome—i.e., the DH or MDA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The<em> Alternate Weather Minima Requirements Table</em> that appears on P. 96 is “<em>predicated upon the aerodrome having an Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF) available</em>.”&nbsp; What happens when a airport does not have a TAF?</p>

<p>In the event that an aerodrome has a published <em>Aerodrome Advisory</em>,<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" style="background-color: rgb(19, 19, 19);" title="">24</a>
 it may only qualify for an alternate airport if the forecast ceiling is
 no lower than 500’ above the lowest usable HAT/HAA, and the visibility 
is not less than 3 SM.</p>

<p>In the case that an aerodrome, does not have a published TAF or 
Aerodrome Advisory, it may only qualify for an alternate airport if, 
based on the Geographic Area Forecast (GFA), the forecast meets the 
following requirements:</p>

<ul><li>
	<ul><li>no cloud exists lower than 1000’ above the lowest usable HAT/HAA;</li>
		<li>no cumulonimbus clouds are forecasted;</li>
		<li>the forecast visibility is not less than 3 SM.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><a id="Fort Langley as an Alternate"></a><h3>Fort Langley as an Alternate</h3>

<p>The question arises as to the use of an airport that lacks a 
published IFR approach and a TAF is not available—as is the case, for 
example, with Fort Langley.&nbsp; To file Fort Langley&nbsp;as an 
alternate, we would have to satisfy the requirement that the “<em>forecast weather must be no lower than 500’ above the minimum IFR altitude that would permit a VFR approach and landing</em>.”&nbsp; Fort Langley is of course located in <em>Designated Mountainous Area #5</em>, where the IFR minimum altitude is 2000’ above the highest obstacle with a radius of 5 NM.&nbsp; An examination of the <em>Obstruction Clearance Circle</em>&nbsp;that appears in the <em>Canada Flight Supplement</em>
 shows the highest obstacle to be 2700’.&nbsp; Therefore the minimum 
forecast ceiling to file Fort Langley as the alternate is 5200’.&nbsp; 
Furthermore, the GFA requirements for an alternate airport must also be 
met.&nbsp; Therefore, the GFA applicable to Fort Langley must provide 
that no cloud will exist lower than 1000’ HAA, there will be no 
cumulonimbus clouds, and the visibility will not be less than 3 SM.</p>

<a id="Utilizing GPS Approaches at Alternate Airports 25"></a><h3>Utilizing GPS Approaches at Alternate Airports <a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title="">25</a></h3>

<p>Initially, GPS approaches could not be used for alternate airport 
planning, and recently changes in regulations were introduced to changes
 this an permit their use, but the changes are extremely restrictive so 
as to make their use largely impractical.</p>

<p>First, a usable approach at the planned <em>destination airport</em> 
must be served by a functioning traditional navigation aid that is 
completely independent of GPS—this is regarded as protection against a 
widespread GPS outage.</p>

<p>Second, only LNAV (lateral GPS navigation) minima figures may be used.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the Pilot-in-command must verify RAIM is available at the 
planned alternate, including predicted satellite outages (requiring the 
checking of GPS NOTAMs—see <em>AIM </em>COM 3.16.12.1).</p>

<p>Fourthly, at lease once prior to the mid-point along the flight to 
the destination airport, the RAIM for the alternate airport must be 
verfied.</p>

<p>GPS approaches as alternate airport are considered non-precision approaches for the purposes of alternate math.</p>

flight plan is not required in uncontrolled airspace raises the 
interesting question of whether or not you really want to operate an 
aircraft where separation is not assured.&nbsp; For the most part, IFR 
flight in controlled airspace means that someone—an air traffic 
controller—is employed to ensure separation between aircraft that are 
flying in cloud.&nbsp; This is not the case in uncontrolled airspace 
where flying in cloud is something akin to Russian Roulette.&nbsp;</p>

job to then advise you when you cross ROSS intersection—“ABC you are 
over Ross at this time . . contact the Tower now on 124.0.”</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref18" name="_ftn18" title="">17</a> The one exception 
is that the HAT for this Vancouver ILS is quite a bit lower than the HAT
 for the Abbotsford ILS—owing likely to vicinity obstruction in the 
approach area of Abbotsford’s Runway 07.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref19" name="_ftn19" title="">18</a> These speeds are Piper Seneca speed.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref20" name="_ftn20" title="">19</a> In reference to 
“standard” equipment, I am referring to the “standard COM/NAV equipment”
 criteria used for the completion of flight plan forms, where the 
designator “S” is used (see <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/media/documents/ca-publications/RAC-AIM-2013-2_ENG-5.pdf"><em>AIM</em></a> RAC 3.16.4).</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref21" name="_ftn21" title="">20</a> The fact that the 
aircraft has an ILS will assure me that the Localiser frequency for 
Kamloops—109.9 MHz. will be received.&nbsp; This assurance does not 
exist with some VOR equipment that lack a glideslope.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref22" name="_ftn22" title="">21</a> If&nbsp; “circling” did not appear in the left column of the minima box, there would be lower minima values.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref23" name="_ftn23" title="">22</a> Based on <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/media/documents/ca-publications/RAC-AIM-2013-2_ENG-5.pdf"><em>AIM</em> RAC 3.14.1.</a></p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref24" name="_ftn24" title="">23</a> <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/media/documents/ca-publications/RAC-AIM-2013-2_ENG-5.pdf"><em>AIM</em> RAC 3.14.</a></p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref25" name="_ftn25" title="">24</a> An Aerodrome 
Advisory is a forecast based on observations that are not taken at or 
near the airport.&nbsp; Advisories are presented in the same format as 
TAFs.&nbsp; See <em>AIM</em> MET 3.9.1 for additional information.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref26" name="_ftn26" title="">25</a> See <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/media/documents/ca-publications/RAC-AIM-2013-2_ENG-5.pdf"><em>AIM</em> COM 3.16.12.</a></p>

<p>Where a descent is required (procedures other than an RNAV STAR, the 
descent should be made during a holding pattern&nbsp;over the final 
approach fix—what is referred to as a shuttle descent.</p>
