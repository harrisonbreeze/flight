<a id="Position Reporting"></a><h3>Position Reporting</h3>

<p>The pilot of an IFR or controlled VFR flight is required to make 
position reports over any compulsory reporting points&nbsp;specified on 
IFR charts, and also over any other reporting point specified by ATC.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">1</a></p>

<p><img alt="IFR Position Reporting Sequence, Langley Flying School" src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Reporting%2520sequence.gif"></p>

<p>The position report shall include the following: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>
	<ul><li>the identification of the aircraft;</li>
		<li>the identification of the position;</li>
		<li>the time over the reporting point in UTC;</li>
		<li>the altitude or flight level;</li>
		<li>the type of flight plan or flight itinerary filed;</li>
		<li>the name of the next reporting point and the ETA over that point in UTC;</li>
		<li>the name only of the next succeeding reporting point along the route of flight; and</li>
		<li>any additional information requested by ATC or deemed necessary by the pilot.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p><img alt="Reporting Point Types" src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Reporting%2520Points%2520type.gif"></p>

<p>It should be noted that the compulsory reporting points are depicted 
on charts as solid triangles, while “on request” reporting points are 
open triangles.&nbsp; Obviously, position reporting over the latter are 
not made unless requested by ATC.</p>

<p>A second note concerning position reports is that compulsory position
 reporting is not to be done once an aircraft has been “radar 
identified” by ATC.&nbsp; Pilots will be advised by ATC when to resume 
normal position reporting practices.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Reporting%2520points%2520sample.gif"></p>

<p>Finally, if the estimated time for the next applicable reporting 
point is found to be in error in excess three minutes from that advised 
to ATC, a revised estimated time should be reported as soon as possible.</p>

<a id="Mach Number Clearances and Reports"></a><h3>Mach Number Clearances and Reports</h3>

<p>Clearances on turbojet aircraft may include a specified Mach 
number.&nbsp; If the Mach number cannot be conformed with, ATC must be 
informed when the clearance is issued.&nbsp; If, after acceptance, a 
Mach number cannot be conformed with, ATC must be notified as soon as 
possible.&nbsp; Where a Mach number is specified in a clearance, the 
Mach number must be included in each position report.</p>

<a id="True Airspeed Requirements"></a><h3>True Airspeed Requirements</h3>

<p>ATC shall be notified as soon as practicable of any intended change 
in the TAS contained in an IFR flight plan or flight itinerary which is 
greater than 5%.</p>

<a id="Climbs and Descents"></a><h3>Climbs and Descents</h3>

<p>When an altitude clearance is issued, the pilot must begin climbing or descending promptly once the clearance is acknowledged.</p>

<p>Additionally, the climb or descent should be made at an optimum rate 
that is consistent with the operating characteristic of the aircraft—if 
the pilot is unable to conform to these rates, or if the climb or 
descent is interrupted, the pilot must advise ATC.</p>

<p>The expression “at pilot’s discretion” is used by ATC in conjunction 
with an altitude clearance to mean that the change in altitude may be 
initiated when the pilot decides.&nbsp; When the change is initiated 
subsequently by the pilot, the pilot will advise ATC.&nbsp; Similarly, 
ATC must be advised if the subsequent change in altitude is interrupted.</p>

<a id="Visual Climbs and Descents"></a><h3>Visual Climbs and Descents</h3>

<p>There are two categories of visual climbs and descents, the first 
concerns the pilot’s visual separation from other aircraft, and the 
second concerns the pilot’s visual separation&nbsp;from terrain and 
obstacles.</p>

<p>With respect to climbs or descents that entail visual separation from
 other aircraft, these may only be authorised by ATC when VMC conditions
 prevail and when requested by the pilot.&nbsp; Additionally, they can 
be authorised in radar or non-radar environments, but they cannot be 
conducted or authorised in Class A or B airspace.</p>

<p>In contrast, climbs or descents that entail visual separation from 
terrain and obstacles can be either requested by the pilot or suggested 
by the controller.&nbsp; Such climbs or descents are restricted to a 
radar environment during a radar-vectoring phase.&nbsp; Note that ATC 
will continue to provide separation from other IFR aircraft.</p>

<a id="Minimum IFR Altitudes"></a><h3>Minimum IFR Altitudes</h3>

<p>Except when taking off or landing, an IFR aircraft shall be operated 
at 1000’ from the highest obstacle within a horizontal distance of 5 NM.</p>

<p>There are two exceptions to this—the first is when the aircraft is 
operated within a Designated Mountainous Areas&nbsp;(DMAs), and the 
second is when aircraft are operating in areas for which minimum IFR 
altitudes have been established.</p>

<p>Minimum IFR altitudes are therefore categorised into one of the following:</p>

<p><img alt="Minimum IFR Altitudes, Langley Flying School" src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Minimum%2520altitudes.gif"></p>

<p>Below is an example of the published Safe 100 NM Altitude, and the Minimum Sector Altitude:</p>

<p><img alt="ILS Runway 07 at Abbotsford, with Safe 100 NM and Minimum Sector Altitudes.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Safe%2520100%2520and%2520MSA%2520Examples.gif"></p>

<p>Below is an example of the published transitions associated with an approach plate:</p>

<p><img alt="ILS/DME 1 Runway 16 at Kelowna showing both straight-line and arc transitions.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Example%2520of%2520transitions%2520on%2520approach%2520plate.gif"></p>

<p><img alt="Mountainous Areas.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Mountainous%2520Areas.gif"></p>

<a id="MEAs and MOCAs"></a><h4>MEAs and MOCAs</h4>

<p><img alt="MOCA and MEA, Langley Flying School" src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/MOCA%2520and%2520MEA%2520example.gif"></p>

<p>Minimum En Route Altitude&nbsp;(MEA) is defined as the published 
minimum altitude ASL between specified fixes on airways and air routes 
which ensures acceptable navigational signal coverage and which meets 
the IFR obstacle clearance requirements. There is noposted next to MEAs.</p>

<p>The minimum flight plan altitude shall be the nearest altitude or 
flight level consistent with the direction of flight that is at or above
 the MEA.</p>

<p>Since MEAs are likely different for segments on either side of a fix,
 aircraft shall in all cases cross the fix at the higher MEA.</p>

<p>In contrast, the Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitude&nbsp;(MOCA) 
is defined as that altitude between fixes on low level airways that meet
 the IFR obstruction clearance requirements for the route segment. MOCA 
are indicated by an asterisk (*), representing an airplane splat.</p>

<p>MEA is always higher than MOCA, but MOCA is only published when different from MEA.</p>

<p>The MOCA, or the MEA when the MOCA is not published, is the lowest 
altitude for the airway or air route segment at which IFR flight may 
occur, and are published for emergency purposes—e.g., an engine failure 
or icing conditions.</p>

<p>The MOCA or MEA published value is based on ICAO standard atmosphere conditions (ISA).</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">Special Note: &nbsp;Since MOCA and MEA are 
based on ISA, extreme&nbsp;caution must be used when air temperatures 
are much lower than ISA, and in such cases aircraft should be operated 
at altitudes at least 1000’ above the MEA or MOCA.</p>

<p>Equal caution must be used when flying in an area of low pressure 
where the true altitude will always be lower than the corresponding 
flight level.</p>

<p>Pressure errors, combined with temperature error, can produce an overall true altitude error in excess of 2000’.</p>

<p>Mountain waves, combined with extremely low temperatures, could make the altimeter over-read by as much as 3000’.</p>

<a id="MRAs"></a><h4>MRAs</h4>

<p><img alt="MRA, Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/MRA%2520example.gif"></p>

<p>Minimum Reception Altitudes&nbsp;(MRAs) are sometimes published for 
intersections where the minimum altitude at which the VHF/UHF signal can
 be received is higher than the MEA for the segment in which the 
intersection is located.</p>

<a id="ATC Altitude Assignment"></a><h4>ATC Altitude Assignment</h4>

<p>In controlled airspace, ATC is not permitted to approve or assign any IFR altitude below the minimum IFR altitude.</p>

<p>Altitudes below MEA, but not below MOCA, may be approved by ATC when 
specifically requested by the pilot in the interests of flight 
safety—e.g., due to icing conditions.</p>

<p>ATC may assign an altitude that is not appropriate for the direction 
of flight along an airway if the request is made by the pilot owing to 
icing, turbulence, or fuel considerations.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">2</a></p>

<a id="1000’-on-Top (IFR)"></a><h4>1000’-on-Top (IFR)</h4>

<p>The provision to operate 1000’-on-top exists so that separation 
restrictions normally applied by ATC can be temporary suspended.&nbsp; 
An aircraft cleared to operate 1000’-on-top provides its own separation 
for other IFR aircraft—especially useful when two aircraft are 
transitioning to or from an approach when VFR conditions exist above 
cloud layers.</p>

<p>1000’-on-top can be conducted provided the following conditions exists:</p>

<ul><li>flight is maintained at least 1000’ above all cloud, haze, smoke, or other formations;</li>
	<li>flight visibility is at least 3 SM;</li>
	<li>the tops of formations are clearly defined;</li>
	<li>the level of flight appropriate to direction is maintained when in level flight;</li>
	<li>ATC authorisation is provided;</li>
	<li>the flight is conducted in Classes B, C, D, or E airspace.</li>
</ul><a id="Clearances to enter or leave Controlled Airspace"></a><h3>Clearances to enter or leave Controlled Airspace</h3>

<p>ATC will use the phrase “while in controlled airspace,” and will 
specify the altitude to exit or enter controlled airspace, and will also
 specify the lateral position at which the transition is to be conducted
 if required.</p>

<p>The altitude specified for entry or exit need only be the minimum safe IFR altitude for the applicable controlled airspace.</p>

<a id="Clearance Limit"></a><h3>Clearance Limit</h3>

<p>The clearance limit&nbsp;of an aircraft is the point to which an IFR aircraft is cleared.</p>

<p>While further clearance is normally provided before an aircraft 
reaches its limit, in cases where the clearance limit is inadvertently 
reached, the pilot shall hold at the clearance limit and request further
 clearance.</p>

<p>It is the pilot’s responsibility to ensure a clearance received can 
be safely complied with in the event of a communications failure.</p>

<a id="IFR in Uncontrolled Airspace"></a><h3>IFR in Uncontrolled Airspace</h3>

<p>When operating in uncontrolled airspace&nbsp;pilots should continuously monitor 126.7 MHz. whenever practicable.</p>

<p>A position report should be made when crossing navigation aids along a
 route of flight; the reports should be direct to the nearest ground 
station, and should be repeated on 126.7 MHz whenever possible.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">3</a>&nbsp;
 The report should include present position, track, altitude, altimeter 
setting in use, next position to be reported and the associated ETA.</p>

<p>Intentions should also be broadcast on 126.7 MHz prior to every 
altitude change, prior to commencing an instrument approach, or prior to
 an IFR departure; such broadcasts should be sufficiently detailed so as
 to enable other pilots to determine potential conflicts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Where an MF&nbsp;is designated for airport, arriving pilots 
shall first broadcast their intentions on 126.7 MHz before changing to 
the MF frequency.</p>

<a id="Holds and Holding Procedures"></a><h2>Holds and Holding Procedures</h2>

<p>The hold entries and manoeuvres specified in AIM<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">4</a> must be adhered.&nbsp; Through adherence, the airspace to be protected by ATC during a hold clearance can be maintained.</p>

<a id="Hold Clearance Format"></a><h3>Hold Clearance Format</h3>

<p style="margin-left:80px">ATC: &nbsp; &nbsp; "ABC, hold clearance when you are ready to copy."</p>

<p style="margin-left:80px">Pilot: &nbsp; &nbsp; "Go ahead with clearance, ABC."</p>

<p style="margin-left:80px">ATC: &nbsp; &nbsp; "ABC is cleared to the

<p style="margin-left:80px">Pilot: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"ABC is cleared

<p style="margin-left:80px">ATC: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"ABC, you read-back is cor</p>

<p style="margin-left:80px">&nbsp;</p>

<p>A hold clearance&nbsp;contains the following components:</p>

<ul><li>clearance to the holding fix;</li>
	<li>direction to hold from the holding fix;</li>
	<li>a specified radial, course, or inbound track that is used for the hold;</li>
	<li>the DME to be used, if applicable;</li>
	<li>the altitude or flight level to be maintained;</li>
	<li>the time at which further clearance or approach clearance is to be expected (in the event of a communications failure.)</li>
</ul><p>During hold entries and hold manoeuvring, the pilot shall make 
all turns so as to achieve an average angle of bank of 25°, or a rate of
 turn of 3° per second, whichever requires the lesser bank.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise specified by ATC or specified by a published hold 
depiction contained on an IFR chart or plate, the pilot shall make all 
turns in the hold to the right—excepting the initial turns conducted 
during the hold entry.</p>

<p>In the event that a clearance limit is reached prior to obtaining 
further clearance from ATC, the pilot shall hold as published on a chart
 of plate.&nbsp; In the event that a hold is not published for the 
clearance limit, the pilot shall hold in a standard pattern in the 
inbound track to the clearance limit fix.</p>

<a id="Hold Anatomy"></a><h3>Hold Anatomy</h3>

<p><img alt="Hold Anatomy, Langley Flying School" src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/HOLD%2520ANATOMY.gif"></p>

<p>As depicted above, a hold is anchored on a fix based on an assigned 
inbound track (whether an NDB track, a VOR radial, or an airway).&nbsp; 
There is a fix end and outbound end on a hold, and there is also an 
inbound leg and outbound leg.</p>

<a id="Standard Holding Pattern"></a><h3>Standard Holding Pattern</h3>

<p>The standard holding pattern&nbsp;is described in the AIM as follows:</p>

<p>Having entered the holding pattern, on the second and subsequent 
arrivals over the fix, the pilot executes a right turn to fly an 
outbound track that positions the aircraft most appropriately for the 
turn onto the inbound track.&nbsp; When holding at a VOR, pilots should 
begin the turn to the outbound leg at the time of station passage as 
indicated on the TO-FROM indicator.&nbsp; (The aircraft shall continue) .
 . inbound for 1 minute if at or below 14000 feet ASL, or 1 ½ minutes if
 above 14000’ ASL <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/media/documents/ca-publications/RAC-AIM-2013-2_ENG-5.pdf" target="_blank">(AIM, RAC, Section 10.3</a>).</p>

<a id="Non-standard Holding Pattern"></a><h3>Non-standard Holding Pattern</h3>

<p>A non-standard holding pattern&nbsp;is the same as a standard hold, except that all turns are made to the left.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">5</a></p>

<a id="Hold Entries"></a><h3>Hold Entries</h3>

<p>The entry into holding patterns is specified and must be adhered 
to.&nbsp; There are three types of hold-entries, referred to as the 
direct entry, offset entry, and the parallel entry.</p>

<p>The type of hold entry flown depends on two factors—the position of 
the aircraft relative to the fix on which the hold has been assigned, 
and the specific radial or inbound track that is assigned in the 
hold.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="IFR Hold Entry Sectors.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Entry%2520sectors.gif"></p>

<p>The hold-entry sectors&nbsp;are depicted below.&nbsp; In this 
diagram, the aircraft have been assigned to hold north of the fix.&nbsp;
 If the fix were a VOR, the hold is assigned on the 360° Radial; if the 
fix were an NDB, the hold would be assigned inbound on the 180° Track. 
&nbsp;As is shown, all aircraft approaching the fix from the north 
(within the sector shown) would perform a direct entry.&nbsp; Similarly,
 aircraft approaching from the south-east (again from within the sector)
 would perform an offset entry, and aircraft approaching from the 
south-west (relative to the sector) would perform a parallel entry.</p>

<p><img alt="Hold Direct Entry.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Direct%2520Entry.gif"></p>

<p><img alt="" src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Offset%2520Entry.gif"></p>

<p><img alt="Hold Parallel Entry.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Parallel%2520Entry.gif"></p>

<a id="The POD Method for Determining Hold Entry"></a><h4>The POD Method for Determining Hold Entry</h4>

<p>IFR pilots must&nbsp;utilise a practical method of quickly 
determining the type of entry that must be flown.&nbsp; There are a few 
minor variations on the technique used, but all incorporate what is 
referred to as the “POD” method of hold entry recognition.</p>

<p>The POD method is based on the pilot visually positioning the hold entry sectors on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_situation_indicator" target="_blank">HSI</a>
 display when the aircraft is proceeding directly the fix on which a 
hold has been assigned.&nbsp; Here is what the pilot visualises:</p>

<p><img alt="POD Depticton for Standard Hold Entries.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/POD%2520standard%2520hold.gif"></p>

<p><img alt="POD Depticton for Non-standard Hold Entries.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/POD%2520Nonstandard%2520hold.gif"></p>

<p>Once the above sectors are visualised on the HSI (or HI), the 
application is simple—but you want to get it right: once the aircraft is
 established direct to the fix (as the above depictions indicate), plug 
in the outbound track associated with assigned hold.&nbsp; Thus, for 
example, in the case of the depictions above, showing what the pilot 
sees when tracking to the assigned fix, a clearance for a standard hold 
on the 300° Radial will require a parallel entry—cross the fix and turn 
left to track outbound on the 300° Radial, and then make a left turn and
 proceed directly to the fix (parallel entries require an “opposite 
turn” (opposite to the right turns associated with a standard hold, or 
opposite to left turns associated with a non-standard hold).&nbsp; 
Similarly, a clearance for a standard hold on the 040° Radial will 
require an offset entry—cross the fix and turn slightly right to track 
outbound on the 010° Radial, and then make a right turn to intercept the
 040° Radial inbound to the fix.&nbsp; Direct entries are considered the
 easiest—if the standard hold is assigned on the 150° Radial, cross the 
fix and turn to a heading of 150°, and after flying one minute outbound,
 turn right to intercept the 150° Radial inbound to the fix.&nbsp; Here 
are some sample hold clearances&nbsp;and entries:</p>

<p><img alt="Hold Direct Entry based on POD depiction.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Example%2520direct%2520entry.gif"></p>

<p><img alt="Offset Entry based on POD depiction.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Example%2520offset%2520entry.gif"></p>

<p><img alt="Hold Parallel Entry based on POD depiction.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Example%2520parallel%2520entry.gif"></p>

<p>In the case of non-standard holds, things are reversed.&nbsp; A 
clearance for a hold on the 300° Radial will require an offset 
entry—cross the fix and turn to track outbound on the 330° Radial 
(300°+30°), after which a left turn is required to intercept the 300° 
Radial inbound.&nbsp; A parallel entry—say a hold on the 040° 
Radial—requires an “opposite” right turn to proceed directly to the fix 
after flying outbound on the 040° Radial for one minute.&nbsp; Finally, a
 direct entry into a non-standard hold requires simply that left turns 
be established.</p>

<p><img alt="Non-standard Hold Direct Entry based on POD depiction.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Example%2520nonstandard%2520direct%2520entry.gif"></p>

<p><img alt="Non-standard Offset Direct Entry based on POD depiction.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Example%2520nonstandard%2520offset%2520entry.gif"></p>

<p><img alt="Non-standard Offset Parallel Entry based on POD depiction.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/Example%2520nonstandard%2520parallel%2520entry.gif"></p>

<p>Caution must be exercised when complying with a clearance to hold on 
an NDB, as the hold will be assigned based on the inbound track.&nbsp; 
If you plug in the inbound track to the POD display, you will get it 
muddled—to have to figure out the reciprocal outbound heading.</p>

<a id="Hold Timing"></a><h3>Hold Timing</h3>

<p>The time requirement&nbsp;for a hold mentioned above—1 minute for 
holds at or below 14000’ and 1-½ minutes for holds above this 
level—refer to the time of the inbound leg of a hold.&nbsp; Whatever the
 wind conditions, this is the standard that has to be met when flying a 
hold.&nbsp; Adjustments with respect to both heading—to correct for wind
 drift—and time—to compensate for ground speed—must therefore be made to
 the outbound leg.&nbsp; The pilot, therefore, must adjust the outbound 
leg—time and heading—to affect the time targets for the inbound 
leg.&nbsp; With respect to heading adjustments, the rule commonly 
applied is the wind drift heading adjustment on the inbound leg should 
be double on the outbound leg—if a 10° wind drift correction angle is 
applied to the left to maintain track during the inbound leg, this must 
be double during the outbound leg—i.e., a 20° wind drift correction 
angle applied to the right.&nbsp; The adjustment of time is more 
straightforward—if the inbound leg is initially timed at 50 seconds (in 
the case of 1-minute holds) after flying a 1 minute outbound leg, the 
outbound leg should be increased by 10 seconds.</p>

<a id="DME Holds"></a><h3>DME Holds</h3>

<p>A DME hold&nbsp;can be specified whereby an aircraft is cleared to hold between to DME distances—typically separated by 5 NM.</p>

<p><img alt="DME Hold Depiction.  Langley Flying School." src="IFR%20Rules%20and%20Procedures--En%20Rouite%20and%20Holds,%20Langley%20Flying%20School_files/DME%2520holds.gif"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A DME hold clearance is provided while the aircraft is tracking inbound or outbound on a VOR/VORTAC radial.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note, in the depiction above, that an aircraft northeast bound on 
V495 (lower left to upper right) would perform a direct entry into the 
hold, while a southwest bound aircraft would perform a parallel or 
offset entry—likely the former, since it would be the easier with 
respect to position reckoning.</p>

<a id="Holding Speed Limits"></a><h3>Holding Speed Limits</h3>

<p>Speed limits govern holding procedures.&nbsp; For propeller aircraft,
 including turboprop aircraft, the maximum speed&nbsp;is 175 KIAS.&nbsp;
 In the case of turbojet aircraft, the maximum speed is 230 KIAS at or 
below 14000’, and 265 KIAS above 14000’.</p>

<a id="Shuttle Procedures"></a><h3>Shuttle Procedures</h3>

<p>The procedures that are used during holds are also used during 
shuttle manoeuvres&nbsp;where a climb or descent is undertaken while 
conducting a holding pattern over a fix—very commonly required during 
instrument departures and arrivals in mountainous areas.&nbsp; Here is 
what the AIM has to say:</p>

<p>A shuttle procedure is defined as a manoeuvre involving a descent or 
climb in a pattern resembling a holding pattern.&nbsp; Shuttles are 
generally prescribed on instrument procedures located in mountainous 
areas.&nbsp; In the approach phase, it is normally prescribed where a 
descent of more than 2000 feet is required during the initial or 
intermediate approach segments.&nbsp; It can also be required when 
flying a missed approach or departure procedure from certain 
airports.&nbsp; A shuttle procedure shall be executed in the pattern as 
published unless instructions contained in an ATC clearance direct 
otherwise.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">6</a></p>

<p>A speed limit of 200 KIAS applies to shuttle manoeuvres.&nbsp;</p>
